I may have said more than I should but when Thomas Keller says " Where do I sign" and wants to be on our board of directors, we feel we have a winning piece of tech.

The skunkpharm chart states for peak thc levels at 252° you'd need the sample to be heated at that temperature for about 30 full minutes, which leads me to believe the time it's taking the brownie batter to get up to the stable temp of ~250, which might take as long as 10 minutes, is taking away from the time it takes for a full decarb, which is why I figured I never had success with just mixing ground, undecarbed weed into the batter straight up and then baking the brownies +decarbing simultaneously

This show is the real US Top Gear in my mind.
The idea behind lemon tek is the citric acid in the lemon juice breaks psilocybin into psilocin.

This person is correct, cannabinoids will bind more easily in an appropriate solvent (fat), and the body does instinctively produce more bile to break fatty acid chains that meander into the stomach, but ultimately this is just streamlining the absorption process for your body, not "enhancing" or increasing the potency of the weed itself.
TL;DR: Eating already decarboxylated weed with fat COULD be expediting THC's trip to the brain, but any reason an experience with the weed+fat combo outperforms an experience without the fat, is for physiological/biochemical reasons and doesn't really have much to do with the modification of the reactivity of the cannabinoids themselves.
Nope, cigarettes have WAY more chemicals in them, not to mention people who smoke them then to smoke them at a higher volume than one does weed.
I'm not sure about that, Darwin is a major port for the importation of meth into Australia from South-East Asia for various Bikie Gangs.
You are right that it is relatively new, but there is actually a very high rate of meth use there which means that there is a somewhat large group of IV users.
Another thing to hold over her head " and are you really going to tell your mom your SMOKING WEED and sleeping around?!?"
Small pin wood to wood joints can be made, and I have built a few of them successfully, but generally require an extremely hard blank of maple to be selected, and I use a proprietary technique to strengthen the fine wooden threads after they are cut to make them considerably more durable.

Stink weed is dope for this, I think I'll run him instead of my crippling fatigue.
I think the big pin joints generally feel more solid but a lot of that depends on the woods chosen for the rest of the cue, particularly the forearm wood choice.
Some woods can give a "soggy" or soft hit regardless of the pin or joint choice.
A cue with a cocobolo, ebony, or rosewood forearm is generally going to feel pretty solid regardless of the pin or joint style.
The pin and joint style contribute to the overall feel of the cue, but are just a couple of ingredients in the recipe that makes the cue feel and play in any particular way a maker wants.

I take tramadol regularly prescribed for fibro and if I take some oxy (15mg which is low for oxy for me) I get a decent buzz or decent high but adding the dph or if I can get the good stuff hydroxyzine (vistiril) really steps up the game and then a couple hits of weed a hour or so into the high really gets me happy!

How do you know how much meth a person has smoked as opposed to how much legal amphetamine someone has taken (the effects are quite similar).
If the argument is "people can't drive on meth because they never take safe dosages" then you run into the problem that by those lines of thought, legal amphetamine drivers should be criminalized as well, because many people overdose amphetamines as well.
Also as an aside, we could limit these problems, as in the case for amphetamines, by legalizing and having strict quality controls on meth.

What I did when I first started rolling was to make the joint really thin.

Returns on growing weed are consistent, predictable, and excellent.
I would sure bet the impact of joint pin and joint collar material selection would be microscopic at best, but I also would not be surprised if there was a statistically-significant influence that could be measured and quantified.
My money still sits on the side that says joint pin and collar style have a small impact on deflection in the grand scheme of it all.
I can throw some weed in, vape however much I want, and then let it sit for another day.
What I meant is: the same way chinese labs make RCs and people take them without them having past any clinical tests, I don't see how a substance a reaction away to be converted to K, Meth or MDMA (to say some examples) couldn't be produced and sold to the final consumer.

I agree with you and Keller (in the article) on this.
Dortmund, Gladbach, Leverkusen all show that you don't need a big name trainer to be successful, all it takes is a good environment between trainer and team and I honestly think Keller did a better job at this than RDM.
I think Keller was a great coach for Schalke, mainly because he was not playing along with the drama and that was something very beneficial for the young players imo.
I feel you there, every once in a while I'll get myself something dope online though

I think that for your first time you should experience shrooms by themselves just so you can get to know them.
And my friend who's taken acid a bunch of times told me that even though weed makes it more intense it kind of takes away from the "lucidity" of the trip, so take that as you will.

No, the actual point is that you don't hit your kids when they misbehave, because it teaches them that physical violence is an acceptable method of dealing with problems or those who have upset them.
My stance is that it is neither effective nor appropriate, as there are other methods of discipline that are effective and acceptable within our society.

Good thing you didn't take a mescaline dose of meph.
Is that any less rediculous? She probably didn't even have 500 dollars worth of Xanax on her.
Would psychedelics be a bad idea for me? Will harboring these beliefs ensure a bad trip? I did a small amount of shrooms once and it was pretty scary for me haha...

There is only one he ran into a fire to save- a fire started during a scuffle between two men over a woman named Lucille.
It was during that scuffle that the officer fired his service weapon, fatally wounding Scott.

You mean apart from the fact that the former 2 are relatively weak in effect, and that caffeine doesn't negatively affect your body, whereas meth wreaks havoc on your health and is extremely strong?

I don't see the relevance, it is your governments job to protect/secure your borders, if it is legal for them to grow opium in Afghanistan then that is not the business of the US, they aren't firing mortars over the border, they are growing a plant and people are buying it and creating drugs and smuggling it into the US, the Afghani farmer shouldn't be concerned with domestic problem or moral concerns of a country half a world away.
Worst case scenario, you just spend a little now to get rid of weeds and then start over in the fall.

My general impression was that if it was something inflamed that should absolutely not be inflamed, such as a tendon or joint then you ice it.

There are quite a few there that defend the opium of the people, for instance, which boggles the mind of this European socialist.
It's probably not a good idea to leave a pound of weed out on a table even if you aren't expecting people.
you cant prove that its weed from a picture, thats why when police arrest some one with weed on them, they call it unidentified substance and they have to test it to confirm its weed.

Hope you realize that if you ever can't get your xanax you're going to have a seizure.
However, just because I said that dumb thing, doesn't mean there aren't other very legitimate arguments for why weed should be legal.

The weed law is kinda weird, so I will just say that if they are in a designated place of consumption and a cop walks in, they will be fine, but otherwise, it is not allowed.

The term you're looking for is Sativa.

That's not how weed works
You just put the weed in there?
The delicious, cheesy meth of the food world.
Doves (and many other birds) swallow pebbles to crush seeds in their crop - its part of their digestive process and they know what's up.
So, if i understand correctly, the effect (dissociation) you had was on sativa or regular meditation practice? And while I know that is a form of induction of meditation, was it intended for focus purposes or just dealing with personal issues? In my experience, that induction has helped me understand personal issues but I havent been really able to implement anything to solve/deal with it.

That dope was duped.
Smoke a fat joint and listen to it I guarantee you change your tune.
Her rational for hating meth stems from her hatred of her father, but you can't hate your father, so it's easier to just vehemently hate the drug instead.

I seriously hope it gets better, because chronic pain is no fun :C But hey, who needs weed when you've got prescription pain killers?!

Whether it was a weed joint or a roll-up.
Once i had decided to quit smoking weed, I then realised that the physical act of rolling up was a tough thing to deal with at first.
I almost talked myself into carrying on smoking as it seemed easier to just miss out putting the weed in the roll-up, than actually not rolling up at all! If that makes sense!
It's tough, but, you learn to address them without the cover of the weed and, for me, things are improving all the time and my confidence in that is getting better as I realise that I actually **can** confront the tougher aspects of life better without the weed.
People are using these mods, and methods similar to them, to break said multiplayer and ruin it for everyone else.

Think you might need to smoke your weed and chill cause it wasn't that serious.
Every single opiate addict under 25 started on oxycodone.

Violant crime and weed are two totally different animals.
Bulgarian top gear is crazy
Amphetamine is pretty startlingly effective, honestly even meth is prescribed for obesity.
Gupta is one such advocate who justified weed use by pointing out these medical applications which in no way support recreational use.
Gupta ignores the negatives, expounds on the positives, and misrepresents real science in order to advocate irresponsible weed use.
Hey got a goldsteing rooster however the joint is chipped.
So they have the dog sniff your vehicle and then let you go when the dog sits because they know it's just weed

Something to take a hard look at is how Harry's conversation with Molly in Cold Days about Odin happens in the same book where we get double confirmation that Mac is not what he appears.
Dresden says that once Molly puzzles out who Vadderrung is, she is ready to actually know.
In fact I have hurt the joint in my right wrist because I concentrated energy there in a bad way.
It took months for the pain and popping in that joint to go away and I was actively working to fix the energy problem there.
I used to call good weed "elevator weed" for that exact reason.
La paz es una mentira, solo hay pasión.
thats some good advice im certainly going to try! and xanax because thats what was offered to me at the time.

I could understand mixing it with alcohol wouldn't be great because mixing downers, but why would mixing it with shrooms be bad?
Hey I have a Goldstein however the joint is chipped.

Also, as I understand (and have experienced), joint wins are very common in this game.
I hear their burgers are dope.
Dude, you're asking if you can sue a fast food joint for messing up an order.

She leaves it up to the states for weed which is clearly putting your head in the sand on the issue, is pro NSA and is funded almost exactly as a republican is funded.
In Oregon you can have bho, but it HAS to be from a 'state regulated' dispensary.

Yeah man I very recently became a legal adult (don't have to worry about posting on here any more whoop whoop) and I'm just realizing the only way for my mom to stop hating weed and blaming it for what I've messed up at, is to stop messing up.
I'd do ketamine all the time if I could get it for that much.
I haven't ever done MXE, but I hear that its basically so-so in comparison to ketamine, but cheaper and more potent.
so how is this top gear related?
A MORNING WITH MOLLY JANE
Maybe you should try to negotiate more, and encourage no joint victories.
The joint im gonna smoke.
I guess it's good that I live in an area with very little *real* crime, but it also produces a lot of whiney, needy, adult-children who go on epically long facebook rants that the police is corrupt because they decided to go smoke a joint in a public park at 4 in the afternoon and got caught, and yet expect the cops to come fix their AC.
How many grams should we add into it? I don't know if the amt of water effectively dilutes the shrooms affects or if we would be okay to just brew it using 6 of our 9gs? Thanks for your help! 
I've known a few officers and they believe a call for a weed means very low risk in violence or escalation.
Sometimes you get a couple teenagers in alliance chat who think their banter about weed or racist jokes are the height of comedy and everybody wants to listen to them.
They all look beautiful, but what the hell happened to the leaves in the Mango Kush Colas picture?
A 780 SLI will be dope and mad powerful.
EDIT: also test your fps when a nade is thrown and a molly as well just in case..
Since Aderall and Vyvance and all those awful drugs are practically some form of speed or another I find that weed is probably a lot less taxing on my system as a whole.
Pinrolling here might make people think you're flexing your new Sauconys too hard, but if you're really trying to show those dope sneakers off then go for it.
I didn't quit everything all at once...I stopped smoking cigarettes 4 months after I left and then quit smoking weed 2 months after that (which I had been doing every day for over 10 years) and then a month after that completely quit drinking too.
You're saying that smoking weed means not being sober, but you're liking sobriety, but don't want to stop smoking weed (even for 30 days).
The man began, "It was down in Chinatown that I met the Opium Queen; babyface girl from Shanghai....never smiled and never cried.."
I'd rather get caught with just weed over getting get caught with weed and a scales.

Replace Xanax with etizolam and you're describing me ahah....
I told my Dr about my addiction and we got on the subject of how easy it is to lie and obtain what is basically meth and she told me they've been trying to be more critical about who needs it.
Chomsky was a Zionist, before the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 even, but one who advocated a joint Palestinian-Jewish state, not a Jewish state of Israel.
My dad is a medical sales rep and smokes weed all the time, everyone is different.
I've been taking 10mg (at least) for 3-4 months now, any advice to get off the Xanax safely? I've already had a seizure once in this same scenario 3 years ago.
I can always count on you for the dope fits.
Tony knew that enough people wouldn't want to work with Spencer that he could keep him around for a little longer and use his votes to weed off the very people that Spencer had tried to flip! Spencer was definitely proactive in spite of his status in the game and it put him within two immunities from FTC.
I'd started messing with morphine and oxy in my teens but never developed a habit.
If you go either on my Facebook page, or my book website page http://genechanger.com, I have whole blogs just related to what you can do for joint pain and arthritis.

Vinnie Paz is more consistent in terms of what his fans love than any other artist...
Acid really is one of the best things for me; I can't imagine how much of an antisocial, weed-smoking couch potato I'd be without it.
Darryl's bag of blue meth on The Walking Dead was pretty good..
And before you waste your dmt and time, you don't smoke dmt (unless you want to sandwich it between weed but I doubt that.) you're going to be vaping this dmt, which means you need to head down to your local headshop or gas station and buy a meth pipe.
I can guarantee mescaline doesn't come on a tab, as mescaline dosages are around 300-600mg, which is too big to fit on a blotter.
2mg of mescaline would be below threshold.
My friends all surprised me by coming over to my house, bearing gifts of weed and alcohol.
However, I'm uncertain if they benefit the joints in the hand as much.
You might also experiment with controller schemes and configurations to avoid using the joints giving you problems.
Plants with low range are useless; even Fume Shrooms have a hard time with mechas.
Or if the Chinese hadn't been subject to forced opium dependency to force British trade relations.
It's impossible, the dose of mescaline is in hundreds of milligrams, which is a little pile of powder, impossible to lay on blotter
My GP, when I was first prescribed, gave me 50mg of Zoloft to take daily, and 20.25 mg Xanax to "bridge".
My company was bought so I have no insurance or a job now, so I haven't been able to talk to my doctor, and I've since stopped taking both, but all I wanted was that anxiety stopping Xanax, in the future I really want to get to a place where I can not avoid every conversation just to stop the anxiety.
Would be so dope if we got a fullish sounding version of Febreze but I dont think that's gonna happen.
Ended up being a really dope article.
This was above all expectations, way better than a hit of acid and overall positivity compared to a great trip on two hits of acid but only half as long.
I would not reccomend an 1/8th(3.5g) as a first experience, but maybe my shrooms are just potent.
I stopped taking methadone 36 some hours ago, and weed with ativan is making this opiate withdrawal easy.
It was that movie that convinced me Top Gear was eternised to be both a motoring show, a comedy programme and a recruitment advert all at the same time 
I LIVE A WALKING DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE KUSH PALACE AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE
I mean, most people I know just call it weed or bud.
It may be worth noting I've always smoked a lot of weed but I understand that smoking can make some people very anxious so maybe those people are more susceptible to the negative effects.
When youre smoking kief because you have no more bud left i usually use a little bit of joint paper instead
The dope doesn't have to win.
I had a friend who would never buy his own weed but would come over and say "Man it's been such a rough week, wish I could light up but I'm out of cash", fully expecting one of us to share with him.
Bone thugs are dope for walk up music.
[Nugs](http://i.imgur.com/hT2UKtH.png) This one is dope 
It's more legitimate that weed or pot, but doesn't have the racially based lineage.
Ask your friend to prove the vendor says there's mescaline on the tab.
It was my day off, my friends were on shrooms and I didn't want to do them.
Speed or meth can be done safely and efficiently, e.g.
Apparently, Molly was caged for most of her life because they just were working all day and didn't want to deal with her.
The fact you smell weed does not grant you any special rights about being free from a smell.
But seriously, why the hell did you do that? Was that guy your only dope connect?
So hot and smoke weed too? You are perfect ;)
these are dope dude
There's a whole bunch of stuff that's probably on the priority list of most governments, and I seriously doubt legalizing weed is up there next to getting out of the economic hell-hole everyone seems to be in.
A joint rolling machine can make better joints than any handrolled.

What enables our body to break down these fatty acids is directly related to an enzyme called coenzyme A, which is an essential enzyme to the body and is used for fatty acid metabolism.
I'm often around sheets of recently laid acid and I really wish I knew more about the chemistry side of things, but realistically I believe it's just something that people say.
then i realised i could make a Top Gear ish video...then added Michael with a heavy coat for the rest :)
How much weed do you smoke?
Not sure why you got downvoted, I think it's a dope tape especially the beats.

When i stopped using xanax i had a seizure one day while i was smoking...
Also tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor to aromatic amino acid hydroxylase, which is NOT the rate limiting factor in dopamine synthesis.
Rate limiting at aromatic amino acid hydroxylase has it's uses.
That guy won a 5k? Was there meth at the finish line? 
Popping a Xanax every now and then is probably not enough to lead to addiction.
At least top gear has long seaso...
All the MC's I worked with were dope and easy to work with.
Haha I thought so too! The scene where they throw the faux baby weed bag in front of the semi makes me genuinely laugh every time
Rolling meth lab
Hear me plead! The weed should be freed! It's what we need! It comes from a seed! 
Honestly I would try shrooms on their own first just to see the effects before you start to combine drugs.
I don't have money for a vape, I work as a waiter but live with my parents as I'm before national service (volunteering instead of military service) most of the money I make goes on weed or for going out with friends.
And I persuaded a pizza/burger/kebab joint in a student-y area to put up a Green poster, they said a few weeks later that it was a positive on the trade they had got (but clearly v subjective)
We've been slower on legalizing weed because every time it was brought up, the U.S.
Nothing is worst than turning around in a crowd and realizing that you've been blowing your weed smoke into a 10 year old's face for the last 5 minutes.
Which is actually a much larger problem, that the system as created has failed to weed out the bad apples, and in fact has allowed them to flourish, at the same time protecting their actions through coverups and denials.
I have seen people light a joint in Quebec City and no one bat an eye, however I've seen people taken away in Calgary for it.
Any suggestions for dope wars style MMOs?
I only smoked about 3 grams a week, usually less than that, but weed was still a problem in my life.
Also, not sure how you are about substances, but a little wine or weed are realky good for getting folks out of their heads so much and lowering inhibition...
It wasn't as bad as jumping off 80mg of oxy but it was noticeable and kept me awake most of the 1st week.
Everyone knows that top gear was scripted to a certain point but they need to figure out how they're going to proceed with whatever they end up making.
anything and everything thats dope haha.
what i do is make a kettle of water, grind the shrooms up, put them in the bottom of a cup, take the kettle off the heat, pour some lemon juice over top of the mushrooms, put tea in the kettle, then pour the water over the shrooms and let it sit for about 10 minutes.
Combined with Allan Kingdoms/Theophilus Londons part it could be so dope 
I was rooting for Molly Ringwald to choose you, man!
Dude, that was the I smoked your weed and not paying for it, what are you going to do about it.
No - the proper aftermarket ball joints are far superior than the OEM joints.
The biggest problem is that owners buy LAPS brand ball joints - the $20 dollar ones.
Get into the $50-100 range per ball joint and you get a far superior joint
It was a chain of events, his freshman year he got caught smoking weed in the Faurot field parking lot.
Not Meth certainly, but I could easily skip one or two meals a day with a medium dose of Vyvanse or Adderal.
Smoking weed with the managers in the bathroom, using the training speakers to blast music in the grill area, eating obscene amounts of quarter pounders, etc.

I couldn't really keep a meal down ever when I was in a oxy phase.
but basically when you make ketamine you get some S isomer and R.
If you're able to inhale all the smoke and hold it in a little bit, there shouldn't be too much smell, but you are still burning weed so take that into consideration.
I bet Top Gear wishes they monetised this years ago now 
When Top Gear drives cars on the show, more expensive cars aren't more expensive for the crews to film...
no show with Top Gear's level of polish and production quality would be run in a way where that could happen.
That said, the city using police (which is *not* law enforcement's fault) as a method of fund raising via quota is morally wrong.
CNN literally showed the officers making standard arrests, there was a little bit of a scuffle between one protestor and the cops but that was it.
I smoke weed because being a little high is easier to deal with than the horrific side effects I got from different prescription painkillers and anti-d's (for pain).

Maybe Masha and Max get on skype and smoke weed together?
Dr Crimmy's! Hell yeah! My favorites are the Berry Crunch with sweet cream and Pebbles with extra sweet cream and extra flavor shot! 
90% of meth is excreted unchanged, and I have it saved in every available receptical and saucepan.
it's also illegal to smoke weed in public...
Finally my doctor actually told me to (illegally) go out and find a weed dealer.
Certainly not Mescaline though.
A blotter can fit maybe 5mg in total, a active dose of mescaline would be 200mg+.
Grindy is games where you can't level to the top gear without doing kill x amount x missions for months on end.
Quitting cigs is far from necessary judging from the number of smokers I know who are long time clean from meth.
There have been studies that said if you smoke one joint a day that you would have the same lung capacity as someone that doesn't smoke at all.
The bottom line is dope sounds.
but in the end dope sounds is dope sounds whether it's something to chop or loop, doesn't matter.
and they fell into silent flatlined biometrics when the oxygen was gone.

I can smell weed all around me but never see it.
One time I was tripping on shrooms and Hate Me by Blue October came on.
On mobile right now, but you should be able to Google concentrations of psilocybin / psilocin in certain mushrooms (say, *Psilocybe Subaeruginosa*) , and thus calculate how many grams of shrooms corresponds to 60mg of psilocybin/psilocin.
Then there are some dosage guides out there for how many g of shrooms you need for a certain level of trip.
How are shrooms? And shrooms with weed, have you tired that

Lol earlier in the game Perkins got in a scuffle with crowder so you had 2/3 of the hooligans involved 
I honestly think all weed is is an illusion, it gives you an illusion that things are better that games are fun that anything is actually fun, but is it?...
I think that is the biggest arguement with weed, that over time and the continued use of it daily it just becomes an illusion and it seeps into your life.
Its weird when you have a good friend that is a strong smoking buddy, you guys have so many connections yet so much of it is usually through weed and the process of smoking before hand.

These people have every right to charge, both to weed out the ebay vultures who are only looking to profit from their signature, and to justify spending days on end at conventions across the country, that can be just as maddening as any other job, not to mention they are taking up their time to do these things and time is money.
After July 1st however it is legal to have weed in Oregon you just probably won't find anywhere to buy it.

I did manage to weed a bunch today, so that some cardboard could actually lay atop the beds now....
I just wish I didn't have to deal with a 50 yr old coworker who has a "driving sober saves lives" ribbon on her car but mumbles to herself all day about which combo of oxy / methodone / percs to take during her next break....
If you remove all air and rolling resistance and every other sort of inefficiency, a car is going to be capped out by engine redline x overall tire size / top gear ratio.
For the McLaren P1, I found a top gear ratio of 0.69 [1] and a redline of 8500 RPM [2]
If I was to have done that I can't stop you from just buying more weed...

Cause my life is dope
As you've pointed out, weed is something that a lot of people actually scare from because its effects are unpredictable.
For a lot of people, in a lot of situations, weed just makes people feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable, and therefore it would make going through opiate withdrawal way worse for no reason.
I have a couple responses why those of you who stay away from weed because you hate the anxiety consider these factors:
- For people already accustomed to harder drugs, weed has its own "magic-ness" but its effects are highly dependent on the subjective mood of the person smoking it.
It also seems to be rarer than saliva strain weed (the head high-producing strains, which I believe contain more THC and therefore cause more of the paranoia in some users).
So weird because I haven't even thought about lucid dreaming since high school (when I used to be able to do it on the regular), then I lost the ability when I started smoking weed heavily.

How can you comment on weed you haven't even tried? 
Nice man I've actually had some chemdawg recently it was a dope strain 
The 2C series sort of killed the market for mescaline - its much more economical for a chemist and an underground operation to produce 10kg of 2c-b (doses are between 10mg and 50mg+) than 10kg of mescaline Hcl (which requires 300mg - 500mg on average).

I was prescribed Doxycycline, and some meds for the joint pain.
This guy's dealer is sells bags with a quarter gram (.25) of dope in them.
It isn't "pure." Prescription meth does have fillers and come in much smaller doses.
Not to mention, there is a much smaller effect when meth is taken orally as opposed to being injected or smoked.
Also street meth can be pretty pure depending on who is making it.
Steve French is a mountain lion that was eating the weed the main characters of the show were growing.
It's ludicrous to me that someone jailed for selling weed could be barred from most professions due to their criminal records, but someone who beats their wife is allowed to compete at an international level.

Actually one of my benefits has been the willpower to stop smoking weed, which has been great.
Tianeptine free acid is Tianeptine itself, not a salt of Tianeptine.
Unpublished research suggests Tianeptine free acid is a bit less orally bioavailable than Tianeptine sodium, but would have the benefit of being absorbed more gradually - and thus would lead to a gentle rise in Tianeptine concentrations in the body, with sustained absorption for several hours - if consumed p.o.
Tianeptine free acid shares some properties with Tianeptine sulfate hemihydrate.
*Neutral salts* are those that are neither acid nor basic salts.

Her reward for serving dutifully as Secretary of State is that she gets the very formidable Obama political machine to join with the Clinton political machine, and if you seriously think enough of those people are going to defect and join Sanders' campaign then my guess is you live in one of the states where recreational weed is legal and you've been smoking some really good stuff.
Wale is dope af.
The best of which I believe is that children should not be allowed to smoke meth because although they are harming their own bodies they have a family that loves them and doesn't want them to do that.
I don't see why you wouldn't take that seriously unless of course you support children being allowed to smoke meth.
When I finally decide to quit, I'm just gonna pop Xanax and sleep for a week lol

Wait, when you deep fat fry chips you add an insane amount of calories to it? So frying something in lard increases the calories? Surely the other fake (or real) Mexican restaurants that have "chips" are much more low calorie, otherwise this TIL is just telling me that fried chips are high in calories regardless of the fast food joint that prepares them.

So, if I were to step outside, they *wouldn't* throw me in cuffs, and into a cage for rolling up a joint? Is it legal to smoke weed now? Also, what Kool-Aid? There are riots going on in Baltimore because a man named Freddie Gray was **murdered** by the police.

The butane will turn into its liquid form in the jar, soaking the weed.
Let it soak for a few mins, swish it around to get the weed off the sides of the jar and everything.
Dump the remaining liquid butane (now containing the essential oils from your weed) into the Pyrex dish.
You will not get as much per gram as other "proper" extraction methods, but this is one of the only ways to go from flower to oil in less than a day.*

We ask if they want to come smoke some weed and they do.
Who handles the finances? Are you going to have a joint account? Multiple accounts? What bills are a priority? What if you come up short on bills? How much will each of you contribute to the bills? Will both of you work? What about after you have kids? How much money do you need to have in savings to feel secure? What about student loans and credit card debt? Do you both want a house and if so do you have good credit? What about cars, do you only want new cars or does one of you only want used cars? What about loaning money to family and friends?

I live in a state where weed is legal and occasionally I smell it on people but I can't say I've ever walked through a cloud of it.
Interesting fact: the name Lysergsäure originates from where it is produced naturally: it is the acid which is released upon LYSis of the ERGot fungus.
I can honestly say though that my best experience with weed has always come from moderate and controlled use.
Was super relieved when you didn't!! I've been off dope for nearly 5 years and it feels good to see others succeed in such a deadly, unforgiving and addictive world.
It'd be hella dope if Vic was on this
That and so many posts that basically boil down to "I'm a Buddhist but I don't believe in karma, rebirth, or enlightenment and I interpret the 5 precepts in the loosest way possible so I don't have to give up my weed and acid makes me a better at meditating 420 blaze it."
In my 3ed dm toolbox there's cannabis sativa listed in a few tables.
Hehe, I just smoke a lot of weed ;)
Which is surprising because I'm coming off of a 6 month binge of a gram+ of 7/10 dope a day.
That may well be the case but we definitely don't want people using meth.
If you can buy a few different types of weed and cycle through them, you'll notice a little less of a tolerance.
Also, I've smoked weed/hash almost daily for 6 years.
Also snorting xanax is completely pointless because it's not water soluble and thus not active in the nasal mucosa.
Does anybody have any experience with the brand Karmaloop? They have some dope mesh floral shorts and I wanna know if they will hold up well.
That's just the weed.
I remember once on Getting Doug, Jeff Ross said one of Doug's eyes smokes indica and the other smokes sativa and I lost it.
I think we share an opinion of sorts, my opinion is that Redbones is the best BBQ joint in the area if you are considering everything other than food.
If cocoa products were decriminaized and regulated meth usage would plummet over the next five years.
I don't know what vaporizing is, seeing that weed is legal here in Holland I am pretty sure he would be able to get one, why and what kind of wax is needed?
A few days later, my dad went out with some weed killer.
"I'm tired of cooking, let's just grow meth instead"
I use one of Romeo y Julieta to store my weed related paraphernalia and in a Cohiba I keep my bud.
Because yes, I smoke weed and cigars and I love them both.
There is actually a video about the differences of smoking versus consuming weed and why edibles are much more psychedelic.
im graduating with majors but took honors courses for the required ones as i was in the joint honors program.
if you think of it sensibly what person is going to waste their time calling the cops just because they had to smell weed for a second while you walked past them.
I smoke weed too, and I agree with you.
These are dope 
In addition, the act of torquing the skull around on top of the spine can mess with the brainstem, which controls many of the lower level aspects of motor (movement) control, for example - maintaining proper joint stiffness during a movement.
Bathroom smoke sessions, although that's mostly because my boyfriend thinks the smell of weed makes him nauseous.
Are those cinex for sale :) I tend to be very bias towards sativa that's why I ask 
I had a non lucid dream once where I was smoking weed alone.

Funny how barheads always seem to think the only Pfizer xanax that exist is bars.
Why there's two different weed related marches so close together...
Or they could straight up do what they do with methadone and just have people come into clinics daily to get their "fix" until the person himself decides to wean off or quit.
She says I'm a good weed smoker.
If working as a DELIVERY DRIVER at a pizza joint deserves $15 an hour, fully paid medical expenses, and other bonuses what makes the people who are working at say, Wall Street "better".
I wouldn't imagine that this 'new look' Top Gear would start right away.
However, to score weed here, you don't need to call a peddler.
There are shops that sell a few Parle G biscuits and weed.
It guess if you used it as a secondary solvent, you could further purify a BHO product.
Also once you get over to Europe then you can just use Ryanair to fly anywhere for a baggie of pebbles and a two day old hot dog.
&lt;grabs a pound of meth and drives to George's house
He found that his rope a dope strategy worked better for him, but he could get down.
*He nods and thinks to himself what kind of person would want to eat fish and chips together* To the fast food joint then!
hoping it would be an opportunity to express our views towards the legalization of weed
You've just experienced first-hand the reason I've decided to distance myself from any public activism towards the legalization of weed.
There are a ton of very reasonable, responsible weed smokers in the city.
It's a real shame, but the whole weed subculture is just about my least favorite thing ever.
Excellent, we should begin taking steps to expand commercial manufacturing independence from Chinese markets, to do this we propose providing large incentives for Indian and Filipino businesses to focus on joint or domestic projects and operations.
Pure Indicas are the best strains to treat insomnia! There's no way I can sleep with a Sativa unless I'm practically greening out
China prior to the British entering the opium trade full force was running a trade surplus with Britain.
Within a few years the British were running a trade surplus mostly due to opium.
One time I was smoking weed with my buddies, and we were messing around and throwing empty bottles and cans at each other.

There needs to be more people who are contributing members of society, who also smoke weed and are not a stereotype, who stand up and hold political rallies.
**You can’t roll a joint on an MP3** *By Gabriel Roth, co-founder of Daptone Records*, discussing why the ritual of listening to vinyl is incomparable to other methods of listening to music.
Y eso nos conduce a una contradicción que no se resuelve ni aplicando la mejor paja mental.
Lastly, Vancouver's drug of choice is weed while Seattle's is booze.
I moved to Thailand about 9 months ago and would come across weed maybe a couple times a month.
This would both weed out or minimize casuals ruining WvW and also prevent burn out by only being occasional and only being one week long.
I can't just smoke weed and then clean the home.
There have been no reported cases of death due to smoking weed *shrugs* But your right, that doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't bad for me.
Granted that when inhaling smoke, you can expect damage, a study has shown that smoking a joint a day for 20 years has very little effect on the lungs.
I'm not sure how to translate it but in my country you call it speed or pep, but it's not crystal meth.
The fact that they can do that and still be functional people with little noticeable impairment when not high is some evidence to me that weed isn't really harmful.
I have made some of the most epic funfetti weed cake ever, it was strawberry funfetti and was baked in a bunt pan.
Grind about 6 grams of weed extremely fine (more surface area = more chances for the THC to leach into the butter.
Add your decarbed weed.
Strain your butter with cheese cloth(do not use a coffee filter), or if you don't mind the specs, leave the weed in.

His shrooms are pretty important for objective control though.
Lonesome Crowded West + Weed = too many feels

Also, dope name.

Virginia wishes to continue the U.S.-Colombian relations notably the joint Airport Security Motion.
I don't really care what the album is called, as long as it's dope tbh.

Once or twice a week is my weed sweetspot.
State guard has the kush jobs.
Emergency response in those high speed trailers isn pretty cool, they do joint work with EMS and law enforcement.
I was able to put away 80mg of xanax or etizolam a day to get a moderate buzz, I wouldn't have trusted carbamazepine to be strong enough
Also I smoked weed for one year.
I don't smoke weed anymore.
Me and my mum are both forgetful, i was forgetful even before i tried pot/drugs (ive actually noticed certain parts of my memory are better...) and my mum has never smoked weed/hasnt since she had me, and even then she wasnt a heavy weed smoker.
I think Vinnie Paz sums it up: https://twitter.com/vinnie_paz/status/594902120840695810
I would imagine a cat would need to eat quite a bit of vaped weed before you have a medical issue.

He scored this kinda dope [flag photo of me](https://instagram.com/p/2Oy9i8g4Zf/)
I also did the math for myself: the cost of a MMJ card amortized over a year wasn't going to save me much money compared to my estimate of the cost of a year's weed from rec shops.
I love that Bruce always defaults to the Fruity Pebbles rap
What can you do? Don't keep weed in your car or on your body.
But the Chinese used opium for centuries before.
Yeah, when I was younger and very inexperienced with drugs, I took an 8th of genetically engineered shrooms.

DUDE KETTLEBELLS LITERALLY ENCRUSTED WITH WEED AND DUNKED IN MCT OIL AND THROWN OFF BUILDINGS FEAR FACTOR STYLE
Did you know weed makes you an amazing driver? I will defend that fact with my very life from you pig sympathizers.
no problem its really common also look up century joints if you save your roaches (you roll up the roaches into a joint for a potent joint and save that roach for another joint made of roaches its fun to see how many centuries you can keep up with)
Also, without government prohibiting free trade, there would also be no need to hide meth labs and such substances could be produced in safe industrial environments.
I really enjoy the taste of the vaporized weed apposed to the sooty taste you can get from actually igniting the weed.
I'm sorry but I wouldn't waste perfectly good weed on Cowboy
Eventually this neurological disease I have progressed and now 5 years later, im 25,Im on oxy.
Reason I mention that is when I was on the tramadol and now on the oxy even after years I've never raised a dosage Bc I built up a tolerance.
each lenny face feeds one roll of kush to my kids.
I don't think OP was looking to smoke a joint with her ex-boyfriend...
there was no mention of weed or friendliness in this post.
His girlfriend (if he has one) smokes a lot of weed to get through hers.
So? Your purse is significantly smaller than a car, and cops manage to find pipes that stink of weed in cars all of the time.
He was funny, scrawny guy, about 6'2 and just smoked a lot of weed.
IMO, I think a lot of the time when people don't get high the first time they either didn't smoke/inhale correctly, the weed wasn't good, or their nerves prevented them from feeling anything.
So getting told off by some random dope fiend really isn't going to phase him.
This song is dope but the official quality version sounds better.
I think the slight issue I have with it is the focus on men in positions of power talking to men (to be fair, he does briefly talk about women being in the conversation), as if men will respond better to male leaders telling them how to behave, rather than through a joint effort - women and men.
you've for sure been to those dope parties at Lit Lounge
First time I did shrooms I was rolling all day at bonnaroo.
Dropped 2 grams of shrooms, and the mdma took all my anxiety about it away.
The best time of every weed smokers 'career' is the time when you explore it in the first 10-20 times.
Oh yes, but as you said "the fact is, there's no way to make fresh psylocibin shrooms taste good".
Instead we have to medicate them, because they're being energetic and rough-housing! (aka being males) and dope them up on Vyvanse! No, I'd say the false medication of children based on an arbitrary standard of behavior determined by those with no formal training on determining medical behavior in children is a far bigger problem than yours.
Smoked weed or done any other drugs.
couple that with a nice xanax dose...
Isn't the sap in milk weed latex based? And that's what makes monarch butterflies poisonous? But is it really that bad for you? 
Just heat up the oil in a saucepan and then when it starts bubbling add the ground up weed.
Take shrooms and MDMA and get an escort.

Your trying to do shrooms and go camping arnt you? 
People point fingers at each and say "You're an idiot! weed kills" and vice versa " You're an idiot! weed is safer than any legal drug on the market!"
OP: Exactly how much weed did you smoke before posting this?
I'm fine with smoking, but when it becomes part of your personality and you start to describe yourself/others describe you as "Slashed45, Weed Smoker" then I find it stupid and silly.
Since you're actually in a position to have a legitimate opinion about it, how did the krokodil thing pan out? I heard that codeine was made prescription (2012 sometime?), very similar to the US pulling the plug on ephedrine (and thus thousands of small labs converting it to meth).
I think people who think this is a big deal may not know how not a big deal weed is.
They don't take them to a friends, they don't have them in the car, they sit on their couch, smoke weed and that is it.
One time I got some OG kush and my friends got some Pineapple express, from the same guy....
In my experience, its usually some dope head who doesn't have a job or family sleeping on a different friends couch and not showing up for court.
Tyga was pretty dope and Ludacris definitely brought it.
Pressly just proved that Molly made the right decision.

How High, Inception, Limitless, Spun (its about meth and every time the character bumps the screen gets all trippy),
If this dude can roll a blunt with no arms I believe in OP's ability to roll a joint with one hand and no sight.
No, at the joint between the upper and lower crankcase halves.
It's important for you to express your feelings without a subversive goal of "getting your way," and more with a joint goal to find out a way for her to meet her obligations to her friend while adequately devoting time to make you feel valued and loved.
There are two types in case you didn't know, indica and sativa.
Indica makes you relax and sleep well, and sativa is all in your head and makes you giggle and act a fool.
My friends and I spent months getting high as balls and then theorizing the concept of ghost weed.
Which is when you get so high that your body transmogrifies into high power weed.
What followed became a fairly complex mythology and system of theories for how this would work--such as, if two people were to smoke the ghost weed in two different locations, would there be two ghosts? We thought no.
So we further theorized that if you wanted to acquire de-ghosted ghost weed, so as to enjoy the very finite, high power resource without hanging out with some strange ghost, you would have to set up some apparatus to ensure that someone else was already high on that weed, hanging out with the ghost.
This would turn into an industry of ghost sitters who would intake enormous amounts of different ghost weed to tie up as many ghosts as possible so that rich people could brag about smoking ghost free.
And of course the inevitable end result of said ghost sitters being that they eventually get too high and explode into ghost weed themselves, thus perpetuating the ghost weed industry in an eternal system of weed based self destruction.
You'll probably miss your flight, not due to the trip (which is ~20 min by train one way) but because if you smell of weed you're going to have face a lot of searches before they'll allow you to board the plane.
54 ain't too old to begin a new adventure in life,becoming a meth addict isn't inevitable...it's possible to use it responsibly not too often 
Iggy is so dope in transition
But it is not near the misery and agony that Oxy or H or suboxne withdrawal is.
If you had a serious 10 year oxy habit just a few weeks ago, I would say you could even benefit to stay on the kratom another 1-2 weeks before quitting.
2 2mg xanax bars
This will create a barrier that will prevent weeds from sprouting in your yard.
Chon! Auras is dope too
*recently started taking Zoloft every morning, used to smoke sativa for day time when I could get it.
Except I can barely afford my rent and food, much less weed to smoke, so most days it doesn't really matter.
I saw them at my school, they put on a dope show
I've experimented with low dosages of psilocybin, (that went pretty great and I don't regret), and I smoke weed occasionally.
Yea I thought she looked pretty dope in that awesome gown.
Now, I'm married, and our joint account makes me nuts- he goes away on business and uses his personal card, then submits receipts and gets reimbursed weeks later.
I *really* want to know if Kelly Benisome was smoking meth on scary island.
There is a video from top gear of Jeremy clarkson driving it while drinking tea.
Was either on Molly or had vodka in his water bottle,either way this video was hilarious.
I have generalized a set of substances to "drugs" that have a extremely negative connotation in my mind, while others such as weed and alcohol are exempt of it.
Dogs are the best, I can't imagine what I'd do if little Molly died :(
Corner store that sells shrooms and a bunch of other stuff.
Wait until you're 18 to smoke weed man...is it that hard?
Seriously though, to be on the side of harm reduction, I'd get some more dope because it could have some new bacteria that may have formed from the stagnant water.
That was called a bolo punch.
I once smoked a joint outside a bar and walked in, the entire bar could tell.

I can see where weed can chill you out and help cope with stress but I can see where this could help as well.
Just because someone gets the chills after not using weed does not make it Phsically addictive.
I haven't gone a month without weed in years, but it's because if I did I wouldn't have a social life anymore.
Just because my friends and I smoke instead of drink weed is addictive?
Take into account the trips through security and possible train delays (not uncommon at all), and I would be too stressed about missing my connecting flight to enjoy myself, weed notwithstanding.
But you're the weed smoking boobies inspector
I wouldn't even say that Top Gear hates Italian cars.

I've never had a chance to get psychedelics and I've never been able to get enough weed to build a tolerance.

I don't think I've ever had a mescaline experience without at least 100mg+ of caffeine in me, and it's never caused any problems.

Stuffing them with weed 
The weed itself was never really a habit on it's own, but what I did when on it is now routine when I perform most tasks.
Such a dope chant
The only con I can think of is that drug dealers would have to sell harder stuff because weed would be commercially available but honestly, the drug dealers would probably just have batter product and they'd stay in business.
Lets all take apart our pebbles now, despite pebbles actual amazing RMA policy.
Gallopin is dope and so is Alaphillippe.

If you DO have joint savings and you're the sole contributor, you might consider opening your own savings account and start putting money in there instead, and potentially even funneling out a little bit that you've contributed to the account (slowly).

Smoking weed isn't nearly as bad as smoking cigarettes, but there is still a risk to your lungs from the smoke.
As much as I loved Top Gear, I would rather just see it die than for it to carry on in some mangled way.
I dont want the BBC to spoil their name or the Top Gear name by trying to revive it and failing.
"We must never cease to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the English-speaking world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, Trial by Jury, and the English common law, find their most famous expression in the **American Declaration of Independence."**

Dude, what if, since you can never smell it when you're currently smoking, you were just finally smelling the weed stench that was emanating from your clothes and body? Or maybe your brain was hallucinating the smell because you wanted it so bad?
Overall, dope idea.
Actually, I just realized two ounces of weed in a month is still less than 2 grams a day.
Are you an idiot? The pizza joint charges those fees because they have to justify having their employee gone for 15 minutes.

I live in the country so now I love to take long walks in the forest with a joint or two, and just experience nature.
While I don't smoke weed I understand (and agree with) why so many people do want it legal:
There's no reason a guy should get in trouble just for relaxing and smoking a joint after a long day at work.
People trying to pretend weed is "healthy" are taking it a bit too far but I understand the movement for legalization because it's about time people can just smoke it in peace rather than being worried about getting busted for it.
Some people I know can't behave normally around others because they dont have weed for later.
God they make life difficult for an honest dope fiend sometimes.

There is no orange weed, just orange hairs which don't have anything to do with the high.
Purple weed also doesn't make the high different.
Purple depends on the strain and it's genetics (Ex.Purple Kush, Granddaddy Purple, Purple Diesel, ect.
Also Indica dominant strains typically grow purple more than Sativa dominant strains.
Are you sure it was meth the first time? I don't mean to doubt or challenge you, but I believe any amount of methamphetamine that could possibly result in a bad experience (or any experience at all, I guess) would make it literally impossible for you to fall asleep after 30 minutes.
You're still not saying much about why the experience was bad, or why amphetamine was even worse than meth.
If you don't mind shooting manual focus, the Zenitar is an AWESOME superwide lens and is super dope for portraits.
Saying that the first time someone smokes a joint it won't do anything is as wrong as saying the first time you take acid it doesn't do anything, or the first time you take morphine it doesn't do anything, or the first time you drink a coffee it doesn't do anything.
Would that be bad practice? I personally think I would need it for later as it'd make debugging easier, however if I ever work in a professional environment, I suppose it's best to weed out such bad habits now.
nice I'm into lots i love eating/cooking i also love painting and smoking weed ahahah :D 
I did meth to stay up so I could work more.
If you have kids and you split up with the mother you also have to buy them a house of similar value then pay the property tax on that too, even if you get joint custody, because the court will make you do this so that the living styles aren't different.

Now we can turn to the maximum joint size a Gekco can reach without modifying the basic nature of its limbs.

Do you smoke weed or what you call "cannabis" in front of your children Jenny?
Here in Colorado, our weed trees are elm and cottonwood.
These drugs are different in the sense that we dont really have specific receptors to react to acid.
As far as weed goes though, we have these specific receptors dedicated to absorbing THC, and if someone has never smoked weed before, it can take time for these receptors to start working properly, meaning the first few times you smoke, these receptors might not be functioning to their full potential, thus, you wont get high.
IMO this explains why its possible for someone to dose acid and have it effect them the very first time to its full potential, while it can take weed a while to react properly in your system.
Not all that into weed actually, despite being from BC
Getting training tips from Keller maybe.
But you are a "bum" if you smoke a bowl or a joint or even vape after the same type of day.

I've always wondered if it had something to do with coming from the opium poppy flower.
As for your 'irrational' fear of drugs, what did you try? And at what dosage? Did you do any research about the substances you were about to try or did you go in blind? Psychedelics and weed are very safe physically and will never hurt you.

According to [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521349), one joint a day for 20 years creates insignificant effects on your lungs by measuring lung function.
What about vaping? edibles? We're not talking about inhaling smoke, we're talking about weed as a substance.
I never smoked weed but a lot of my friends have.
Anyways, great job quitting cold turkey! At least from what I've seen when your actually get addicted to weed its decently hard to quit on your own.
The great thing about Top Gear was the banter and joking between them as they went on cross country trips and challenges, but even that was feeling more and more false recently.
I would advise dropping the weed as well, but others might have more to say about that.
I quit weed long before I quit booze.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to weed out everyone who is toxic and negative without far more serious and sweeping reporting systems.
If there isn't a gas attendant out there I will guarantee you some one will light up a joint or cigarette while pumping.
I love weed normally and smoke a ton during rolls, just never before I start coming down.
I also smoked a lot of weed which was my number one saving grace, if you're into that.
I did speed once, maybe it was meth, I wasn't told what it was.
Can weed even be poisoned? And if it can..
My history with weed is somewhat muddled, confused, complex, and love/hate.
If you guessed *extremely* strong weed, you get a cookie.
I'm not sure if acid just has a really strong affect on me or not though cause whenever i trip with people im always the first to come up and the last one to come down, sometimes not falling asleep until two days later
The phelps weed thing actually did end up damaging his image pretty bad (at least here in america).
If you have no tolerance to Xanax then start with just 0.5 mg.
There was a whole bunch of stuff, the 2 most memorable was one of the FORWARD break pads was basically split in half so that and another rotor, as well as a ball joint needing to be replaced.

I've seen my friends who were the nicest guys you would ever meet, turn into complete psychopaths after they started using meth.
I've done acid a couple of times, and I only got serious hallucinations once, and I think that was because I also smoked weed while on the acid.

You know the disc is out of position temporarily when the joint is popping.
I recall my friend's friend mentioning that it was a (part-)medicinal sativa strain when he was explaining it to me.
And to answer your original question: I think it will get you a slight buzz but you're wasting a lot of weed this way.
Didn't you know meth is the devil before hand?
Rent the original clerks and smoke weed about it.

They could be just trying to rob any weed dealers.
Outside of a few minutes in each challenge, the dialogue in Top Gear is extremely forced.
* I've been out of the loop regarding JKT since the joint concert with AKB earlier this year, but I was pretty surprised Melody got third.

I've bought grams and grams of 2C-B from him as well as 100 tabs of acid and all have been amazing.
when a methhead stole his car and got caught with meth in said car he stated it was the owner.
Anyway, meth is a different beast.
Not even two days after, I thought to myself "wow, I'd feel better if I had more meth!" And then realized how messed up that thought was.
That being said, I do get the spins if I drink too much with my weed.
Sandwich it between weed so you get the weed melting it slowly, and not the lighter insta burning it.
If you buy weed from a street dealer or a friend, you're not getting medical grade stuff.
They were no top gear UK though.
If you're asking because you don't have access to an oven/house that you can cook weed in, my advice is to wrap it in tinfoil and throw it in a campfire for 10-15 minutes.
Many of them have had joint service experience to give you better perspective.
I don't want to carry around some goggles just so a little smoke that blows at me every now and then doesn't annoy me a little.
The meth wouldn't have actually been blue.
The purest meth possible would have been pretty colorless, because the colors are impurities 
Slurp by JUS - similar to drinking the milk out of the bowl after some Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles have been soaking in there.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have too, I've been smoking for a good long time now and I've had both positive and negative experiences with weed.
Great mixtape though full of raw emotion, dope lyrics and abstract raps from Ab-Soul.
His brother talked my boyfriend into trying molly.
Yea idk if the weed your smoking is just bad, or maybe its just your own personal reaction to being high.

Muramasa Rebirth Special Edition comes with a pretty nice case that has a hard shell screen protector (that you open via top joint to play).
Writer of this article proceeds to buy a flat billed hat and some Molly in an attempt to be cool.
Smoking weed after tripping causes what people call an 'afterglow' effect, so it may have been that
First off, never forget Hulu is a joint venture between FOX, NBC and ABC.
I had taken ecstasy tablets before, and I knew that it was probable that some had contained meth.
So I got some molly powder and some meth and mixed my own.
Pets can have a bad reaction to plant matter or the chemical impurities on the weed (pesticides), but *all* animals have endocannabinoid systems.
I would need 5 Xanax to even get me in a place where I am not freaking.
Not to mention how he embraced the bolo tie and Felipe Rios.
Spliffs (as they are supposed to be 50/50 or more by tabacco) are even grosser, but most people I know just use spliff and joint interchangably
We have a joint account, but I was using the debit card for his personal account.
Muscles don't hold the arm up, they can only contract the joint using the tendon.

Everytime I did oxy I wanted to do it more, very often, but I handled myself.
They removed 80%of Top Gear before I could get halfway, I don't have time to binge and when I did it was Top Gear I would indulge in....they took that from me...Netflix took that from me.....at least I still have Doctor Who
Forgive me if I misunderstood, but wasn't the meth only blue due to the replacing of cough syrup with (iirc) methylamine? Or would that still reduce the purity? I don't really know much about meth.
My original point was just to explain that weed *can* be addictive and that it *does* have negative health effects.
Also funny you mention about only getting to a [4] or [5], i got some of the best produce recently and tried it in the Pax2, got a decent head high, next day had a joint of the same stuff and i was a [10] instantly.
The meth made in the show is 99.7% pure, which only leaves 0.3% for impurities.
Tubular Tacos is doing work, him an vermy are a dope pair, Sharp's *okay* i guess.
Its a weird joint to begin with and I noticed if you have it wrong it makes it look uneven so maybe try paying with how the joint works.
Suge actually dope imo.
EDIT - That being said, Suge has some dope writing occasionally too
I've been through the process OP is talking about, not meth though.
I'd love to see that study, and why would I pop molly more than 2 hours before my favorite dj takes over the stage?
And no but i did smoke a joint earlier but i live in Seattle so it's legal.
I'm also on Instagram, I'm on there way more promoting a dope sox company.
That bakery looks pretty dope though.
Could be impurities, could also be the energy band gap of the meth molecules and their meth **really is** -- 100% pure.
I have no idea what the band gap of pure meth is, though :/
It stands to reason that if he can create 99.7% pure meth without sending it through hundreds of wasteful purification cycles, suspension of disbelief can explain the blue color as a byproduct of his secret method.
Why prevent this when you can repeat these anti-Muhammed rally's more often just to weed out the nut jobs.
The overwhelming majority of people, especially in a college town, aren't going to take the time to stop and call the police to report someone walking down the street with a joint even if they do think smoking should be a crime.
On the off chance anything bad does happen, you can minimize personal risk by only carrying what you're going to smoke and nothing else (including paraphenalia) and eating the joint if you see any cops rolling up.
I offered to go on GC and weed out possible active members but they said that they believe active players will naturally find their clan.

Smoking weed and getting drunk is pretty much all I do with my friends during weekends at college.
Your brother would be screwed and police would know that weed is smoked in whatever car you use, so you'd greatly increase your chances of getting caught by police in the future my friend.

The only difference between weed and cigarette smoking is no one holds in tobacco smoke
Automated systems help them weed out the ones that are so badly prepared that there's no point in taking it any farther.
I used to smoke a ton of weed, at one point I was spending about $80/week on it.

I smoke weed everyday, but I know this has the potential to ruin my life.
**S**noop **D**ogg **S**mokes Weed '**U**ryday
If you buy ANY goods whatsoever from companies that outsource their labor (almost all of them, btw) you've done more damage to the economy than a boat full of fat people, meth addicts, and chain smokers.
Although, if you think it's a good idea to smoke weed instead that's 100% your choice and I'll respect that.
Kevin Abstract is pretty dope though.
What other psychedelics would you recommend? I LOVE shrooms and they're readily available and I know what I'm getting.
It made for a dope shot though
My drug intake used to be a many-hued tapestry, which made for fun adventures and cool stories, but by my junior year of college I was dumping all my cash into dope and dope alone.
If you are smoking weed inside it will smell regardless of if you use a sploof or blow the smoke outside as the weed will smell still(it is more obvious than you think to someone who knows).

I have the same joint pain as soon as I go above 10mg/day.
people who smoke weed generally are very kind/approachable and love to share.
I have never done any drug, but I feel shrooms would be my first step.
Any dope could go to the gym for a year and have a similar muscle build as this guy, probably better.
I mean if you say you love shrooms and they're accessible, then that sounds perfect.
Now no one's getting arrested over a joint ! Justice
i dont know i gave my sister a pretty good sized dab for her first time smoking weed and she said she didnt even get high
"We must never cease to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the English-speaking world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, Trial by Jury, and the English common law, find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence."

I hear the call of a Chinese opium dens louder than ever.

im guessing some people just enjoy weed all the time.
I took an 8th and a 1/4 of really good shrooms and I was borderline insane.

The sneaky part of weed withdrawal is the effect on mood, which doesn't really manifest completely right away.
Haha yeah the icon on the bottom left if is the phones battery percentage and the pebbles is on the bottom right
American here, we love your so-called Top Gear and hate our lame American version.
So I guess unless I'm a doctor I can't say whether binge drinking or smoking meth is unhealthy lifestyle right ?
Sometimes I hate the dope game.
Sure, just use a male joint to hold the female and vice versa.
Anyone using TV show to cook meth probably deserves to be blown up
American Muslim Joint Statement On Crisis In Iraq and ISIS http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/american-muslim-joint-statement-on-crisis-in-iraq[9]

* Bhopal disaster (Union Carbide and pesticides)
I remember that Vietnam special of Top Gear lol if I recall there's a point where they each get little motorcycles to go around in.
Ha! I was arrested for possession of less than a gram of weed and my bail was more than someone in jail for domestic violence.
these are looking dope af
However shrooms and opiates/opioids are a complete different story.
Just buy a lot of weed sometime.
Thanks man, dope fit!
Colorado Kush master race!
I'd also start lifting, keep my brother from getting into xanax addiction, and be more social.
Even at top gear levels with very high CDR you have things blinded at best 66% of the time.
I never saw top gear as being so daring, sure they made a joke here and there about a political figure but that's about it.
My boyfriend at the time was a dealer and got me to smoke dope twice.
Me and my so share everything I would never do anything with out her as far as dope goes when I have she has and she she has I have even if just one bag we share it 50\50no matter what that's tue only way to do things 
In any case, live has all kinds of opportunity to grow and learn, to include running ops, joint ops, using command channel, setting up scrims, and so.
The other thing is in general if you smoke weed alcohol tends to be less attractive because people get drunk and crash cars, while people who smoke just enjoy everything in life a little bit more than when they're not high
My underlying anxiety is getting worse, I'm not coping emotionally at work and I can feel my brain fuzzing more and more - no doubt partially age, partially weed but also the alcohol.
Since Top Gear has already been mentioned, I'll say Mythbusters.
But the fact is weed is still illegal and I don't need a felony on my record.
havent smoked weed in 4 years
But how in the world can you feel justified in verbally expressing your disappointment to someone over wearing a TANK TOP? I mean, if you had killed someone in cold blood or if you had been stealing money from her from years without her knowledge and been spending it on meth or something, then I could understand maybe, just maybe saying to someone that you were disappointed in them.
They are so in denial about the fact that they're use meth.
The answer is because the handy-dandy MCAT we were just talking about has weeded out poor students who cannot grasp that material from the residency applicant pool.
Most of my "withdrawals" when I smoke weed are with my mood, I get weird around 11:30 pm because that's usually around when I can smoke my first bowl of the day if I haven't been hanging around friends.
* Yeah, I'd say that explains Molly's behaviour toward Case then.
Oh snaps, that's dope good looking out.
i always drink enough on acid to get a buzz and it feels great but i have a hard time drinking fast enough while tripping to actually get legit drunk at the same time.
Is there a difference in the morishness between klonopin and xanax?
I believe the mescaline can be precipitated out of solution by creating a hypertonic solution from boiling the cactus, then adding concentrated acetic acid.
Are you married or do you have any family that could administer the dope as prescribed? That is how most people I know do it, give the drugs to a loved one in close proximity to manage the dosage.
Make sense? It is used to weed out the guys with no budget, and the 10% component for larger budgets reflects the extra work that often (but admittedly, doesn't always) go into the campaigns with larger budgets.
I know it has nothing to do with the weed I'm just really worried they'll tell my mom if they do find thc
That's what the dope song is about?!

You can not have a card without the people at the shop knowing that you smoke weed.
Streetwear isn't just about putting together dope fits, I put style into everything I do.
According to the link I just posted, yes you can get $100 for joint filing.
Also, just because something is powdered and sold as molly doesn't mean MDMA is the only active ingredient.
But I haven't tried that pebbles version from /u/redbic, might have to give that a try.
The cops can still smell weed over gasoline.
They get the blimping radar, they get 1 molly 1
Seriously tell your mom you saw blood in your pee, you don't have to mention the weed just the blood, and go see someone who can find out if anything is wrong.

Eight months now with only weed and the occasional pill or so, getting harder and harder to stay away tho, nothing compares 
i took shrooms today too.
If people could OD on weed as easily as you can on alcohol, do you think legalizing it would have nearly as much traction as it does? 
This is my first time ever seeing weed in person.
I don't want to smoke weed in the parking lot.
I don't think your design is flawed, just add some strength to those joint areas.
I've worked with smokers, obese people, and even meth heads.
Was the plan to stop the train and steal the meth making juice? 
Even on acid I haven't gotten paranoid which is really nice.
It mentions that it had no idea Case would have the Flatline go balls out on the security system to find Molly, as example.
I don't consume weed by vaping or any other method but am curious, is this something that is happening more often as vaping becomes more common? Is there a viable safer method (baking/consumables?) Would it be a problem if it was only every now and then, as opposed to a constant influx of vapor?
Buy hard ones and give them a try.

* Joint and Light My Fire (Shakugan no Shana)
I can't answer the first questions but I was at Machus the other day and they had those there, they seemed really dope and pretty good quality, but I've heard Represents quality can be a little "iffy".
Execution for carrying weed.
Carrying weed would be solved with a 50000 toman bill ($15).
I had a dream marrriage for 13 years (or so I thought) then drugs happened mainly meth &amp; mushrooms.
But if you smoke cigarettes you should also smoke weed to minimize the negative effects of smokng tobacco.
"Perhaps you're looking for opium huh? Perhaps you should leave while you still have your precious fingers, scribe."
So much more intense than the weed high.
The best part for me is being in the water with a joint in hand.
As I understand Ballot Measure 91, it will still be illegal to sell or even give away weed (or presumably seeds) until "official" recreational dispensaries open sometime in 2016.
I dont want to them to think ive smoked weed befoe
I can be 18 and buy weed with a med card
Klonopin is much longer lasting and has different applications compared to xanax.
If I took shrooms and just sat and hallucinated to it.
That I am THOROUGH in my research of cordless lithium ion powered weed trimmers.
Take [DOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine)/DOC, a lot of the meth cooks figured out that you can make this stuff in one pot.

I smoke every day, but lets be honest, smoking weed is hella bad for your lungs
Even if it's 1/10th of what the old Top Gear was, it will still be better than most TV shows.
that being said opium is awesome for medical reasons one of the best painkillers available 
forgot to get my weed license renewed so got benched from deliveries for the day.
"today I'm going to do meth!"
I had major anxiety issues and was prescribed xanax, then klonopin, then some other benzos until my doc said that I should have figured out my anxiety issue by now and stopped the prescriptions.
I believe a similar path could be followed to meth as amphetamines are prescribed by doctors for various things.
I was in my buddy's bathroom looking at myself wondering why I smoked weed, when I said I never would.
Show her the facts about opioids, amphetamines, and such as medicine, and tell her how racism and misinformation had a hand in labeling what weed is today.
They had me on that, Ketamine and something else when relocating my foot.
I'd have Heston Blumenthal and Thomas Keller cook for us because food is beautiful, and if I'm going to have a bunch of artists talking about art together, I may as well have two culinary artists collaborate on a meal.
Really dope ;)
BISU NEEDS TO NOT SMOKE METH ON TRASH TALK MONDAYS
Once, I honestly had a guy, hand to God, put a He-Man model on the table as a proxy.
Why don't the BBC just sell Top Gear to Jeremy Clarkson with exclusive distribution rights.
A lot of weed and a lot of booze is a recipe for the spins.
I feel ya though, im pretty much constantly smoking weed and almost never do other drugs without it these days.
I hear Top Gear is looking for a few new faces.
A kid that can't drink at their own wedding, can't smoke a joint in the sun....
As long as they're willing to share the meth then I'd say it's the place to shoot.
Wait, so do you think that the physical requirements to go into law enforcement or fire/rescue are there to weed out females or to replicate potential situations where baseline strength or speed are required?
People usually just go there for buying/smoking weed though.
Still want to try mescaline..
It was last summer, and Molly is still happy and alive :)
It started innocently enough, couldn't smoke weed cause I had to drop, figured I'd grab some hydros.
We smoke weed with tobacco in melbourne, Australia :) 
In the second case, it's also not the pot that damages your brain but is instead the fact that you're depriving yourself of oxygen by holding your breath for so long.
I've done 120mgs of oxy today and it's barely helped with the cough.
The names you are rattling off, will at best, make very boring presenters for Top Gear, each of them trying too hard to be "car-focused".
Weed isn't this magical herb that is completely harmless and is only beneficial so you should smoke it every second.
It was absolute bliss! The roll felt softened in a way when weed was used to finish it off
My (former) uni started us with C to weed people out then moved on to similar concepts applied with OOP using Java, which is actually great since profs for both emphasized design patterns over the ins and outs of syntax.

I only smoke weed on the 4th of July.

A lot (if not most) people who smoke weed usually try to not broadcast it to the world.
Huge difference from the doc usually using the broken joint figurine they always have in their office.
Without it, the additional self-doubt is only going to get worse as the courses get tougher, and there are some hard ones in there.
All of that is dope as hell and all, but do enlighten me into what am I supposed to cook while playing her becasue I tend to go near ultimate-bravery builds as I have not found where is my comfort zone on Trist.
You'll either have to be okay with being late to joint events for the rest of your life, or find someone else who knows how time works.
I tried to play Top Gear for SNES recently, and it's...
Huehue i'm so cool and edgy, I even take shrooms! Sometimes I even sniff weed or smoke ecstasty!
That really sums up so much right there about why weed is so damaging.
So an un-named source claims to have overheard the ex-producer of Top Gear chatting to a singer who was known to be a friend of the old Top Gear team.
As well as the rest of the Top Gear technology centre.
If you have a joint banking account, withdraw all your money and put it into a separate banking account before you leave if at all possible.
Well being a lawyer for meth producers isn't exactly ethical is it? (I don't know the definition of ethics or morale and all that but you know what I mean?) He'd take the money now, and engage in criminal activities as a lawyer

Just smoke weed.
I wouldn't worry about the physical symptoms of kratom; they'll be much less severe than getting off oxys - much less.
The hard part (especially with a 10-year oxy habit) is dealing with PAWS, and adjusting to life without drugs to help you cope.
My buddy told me meth was the same thing just better.
People never seem to believe me when I tell them that if they've gotten high on Adderall, they've gotten high on meth.
Smoke weed instead.
An added plus is that the 48/15 gearing it came with is working on making my legs resemble those of a He-Man action figure.
went from "food tastes so much better when you're high!" to "i need to smoke a bowl to eat a meal" "video games are so much more fun when you're high!" to "i need weed to stay focused on the game for more than 5 minutes"
MXE and Ketamine come to mind.
Even if he were to wait 5 years, then take another pill of molly, he'd probably barely feel effects.
The only 'dream team' of Top Gear presenters to replace Jeremy Clarkson is May, Hammond and Clarkson.
Don't listen to those ignorants who tell you that "smelling of weed" can give you any problems boarding your flight.
I'm a very frequent flyer and board planes at Schiphol airport all the time to destinations all over the world, I also smell of weed regularly as I have the habit of smoking a joint outside the airport before boarding.
I love smoking with my friends because it's fun to be around them and weed makes it more fun, but it's also nice to get home after a really long day of work or something and just light up in my room by myself and chill.
The head of the fibula forms the proximal (superior) tibiofibular joint with the lateral edge of the tibia.
From the proximal tibiofibular joint, the fibula extends slightly medially and anteriorly in a straight line toward the ankle.
At the medial malleolus, the fibula forms the distal (inferior) tibiofibular joint with the tibia and also the talocrural (ankle) joint with the tibia and talus of the foot.
The proximal and distal tibiofibular joints permit the fibula to adjust its position relative to the tibia, increasing the range of motion of the ankle.
The lateral malleolus also forms the lateral wall of the talocrural joint and reinforces the ankle joint.
Do not smoke weed when withdrawing from benzos, OP.
Smoke weed everyday.
2 - Because i refuse to work in a fast food joint or as a janitor
"I was so worried and scared because of the weed residue that I went and replaced it with poison residue"
I rolled a joint in the shape of harry potters scar once
I'm not sure if it was just weed that caused this, but one time my brother (who has a decent tolerance) was vaping and after two or three hits, he put his head on the table and then fainted in the chair.
I'm not a smoker but weed and booze aren't any better.
I know you didn't say weed or booze were a better option.
He grew weed when I was growing up and from the age of 8, I would help him trim and take care of the plants.
I don't do anything else anymore, not even weed or alcohol, mainly just because I have no interest in continuing.
Most we ever did was smoke weed together or take a few xanax or something.
Popping a few pain killers at a party, of varying types (percocet, oxycoden, etc.), is unfortunately a social norm at some colleges and universities.
Panda says he smokes weed some in private, usually when he's mixing.
dopest dope I ever smoked..
You still think about dope, but it is different....
He was steadied after bumping Bolo in turn 1, then went 5 wide through the 2nd turn...maybe the worst trip of the 19 horses and he still finished a strong 5th.
All of Top Gear UK.
This is a big deal for those who go nuts when craving dope.
Can confirm; ill happily ride 30+miles, just with several weed stops.
A joint activity/interest to use as a hook to introduce yourself.
There will be some extra stiffness the day after but nothing a bean bag and a big fat joint can't fix
this article reads "they look amazing, are dope at farming and metal smithing.

Try vaping your weed instead of smoking, might help with the paranoia/anxiety.
That was dope as hell!!!
Social booze and weed, solo weed.
I used meth primarily to have fun at parties, because I'd always been anxious around people, I also started to use it before work since I had to work really early and while at university I was struggling to keep my focus.
I want a Clarkson project to *murder* TG financially and in ratings, but I don't want to see a woman blamed for New Top Gear failing.
It was more than just a weed charge.
I know a lot of people say smoke weed but for me that wasn't that case.
I looooove smoking weed but while on MDMA it does something totally different and made it an unenjoyable experience.
Naaaa he just has some fizzy weed bro.
Because i refuse to work in a fast food joint or as a janitor
Saying the "F-35 is expensive" or "We are a small country" is a cop out for spending as little money on defense as possible even though they have obligations, i know it's not your fault, you've even served, it's still frustrating to other's who they are obliged to be a joint force with.
Wait till they get to college and smoke some weed though hha....
If your car finance comes out of your joint account, why doesn't the finance for his new car also come out of your joint account?
Most people smoke meth out of them is what I heard 
Well I did enjoy Jodie Kidd on top gear and hopefully the other two are good enough.
Also note that I'm not discrediting this advice because weed helps a lot of people, but until you know that it works for you you could experience the complete opposite effect.
I've done truffles around a dozen times and regular shrooms many dozens of times.
We normally have fruit on standby for the comedown, and a joint.
Truffles compared to shrooms are more "visual" for me, more often than not my vision is covered with patterns and I notice sharp edges more.
I suspect that they'd release it weekly - Netflix has been doing that for a few different shows, and Top Gear has a topical element in the news segments.
I think its pretty weird but yeah I smoked a joint and felt nothing tried half a joint a while later (Same baggie) and got high as hell.
So if you use Kush SS for example, oryo will not have AGB b/c that is her gauge.
Find a dirt road in there and cruise around for a bit and you're bound to find a dope campsite.
If [5{ öde the Mist someone Dan gez high, zehn a [7] is Prettz dope 
Coffee is a more harmful, unhealthy, and addictive drug than weed is, and people drink it regularly every day.
I'm not saying to smoke weed every day, but you'd be healthier than the guy drinking coffee every day.
And keep in mind tobacco, beer, and coffee are 100% legal with worse health effects than weed.
Well if these mixes of chemicals are natural, then yes, ecstasy and street meth and huffing paint is natural as well.
Some guys just need to learn to take a hit and chill instead of wanting to talk about weed for hours on end -_-
I have smoked a lot of spectacular weed for a long, long time.
(tried it in highschool/college) Probably hasn't smoked weed in 10 years at least.
oh dope ill get it.
Dude, that was enough to make He-Man cry.
If you're having weed problems, it works even better to unfold brown paper grocery bags so they lie flat, cut a slit so they fit around the stem of the desired plant, and put straw on top (then water) to help weigh down and hide the bags.
Shrooms for me (though they're different for everyone) have always been more of an emotional experience (not in a bad way, i just mean that that's the element that it rolls around in - amplified emotions and warped reality), whereas acid has always been more of a mind-bending experience.
You can get mescaline by growing the mescaline cactus yourself.
I can always smoke weed no matter what else im on.
riddle me riddle me Randy Roe, my father gave me dope seeds to sow
Also was told that acid stays in your body for the rest of your life and in your cerebrospinal fluid.
That's dope man.
However, Google Rotator Cuff exercises; these are the prime stabilisers and movers of the shoulder at the joint, so will need serious strength work.
FWIW I've torn 2 off the bone on my right shoulder, lost 1/8th of an inch off the collarbone, had the AC joint redone, and that took a full 12 months of rehab.
I remember listening to Andy Wilman talk about why Top Gear was so successful once, he said something to the effect of "It's a trip into the male mind, which is an incredibly interesting place because nothing happens there"
He was on Top Gear too.
This year the headliners feature Railroad Earth, Keller Williams, the Steepwater Band, Random Rab, Earphunk, and Mingo Fishtrap as well as a ton of other good stuff.
He wasn't "representing" them, he was helping them build and run a meth empire.
That's dope man.
Diabetes, heart disease, joint problems, and [a host of other diseases affect](http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/obesity.htm) obese people sooner and more frequently than normal-bmi people.
Since meth is so physically damaging, the longer I would have waited the better.
I don't know what's gonna happen in the future, I could even become a full blown every day meth head.
Creatively dope and entertaining.
also taxes the new weed dispensary realty show on tv the first day of sales they made 15k just in tax revenue for the town they did business in and before the first day of recreational sales they were trying to push them to the outskirts of town with the other mmj dispensaries so it wouldnt hurt the towns image.
Reddit, where you can get downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that a TV show about meth probably doesn't actually produce meth.
A few years later and oxycodone goes for about $1 per milligram.
I've been smoking weed just to be able to sit at my computer or get out of bed.
Dude if you think weed doesn't have withdrawal symptoms you're oblivious.
uh it rains all the time the weed and coffee are no good and if you even think about adding one more car to my commute on 405 I'll punch you right in the kisser
Think that it was confirmed they were just filming new material for their live shows since they can't use Top Gear clips anymore.
Have you tried CBD strains instead of high THC ones? Klonazepam, Klonopin, and Xanax will cause psychosis on detox if you become addicted.
Don't know if he makes much but it pays for the cabs for everyone ther, the facility, the cameras, the crew, the bandwidth, and maybe the weed.
"barbie sets unrealistic physique ideals for women", yes well he-man is no average joe either.
It's just that they'll have a joint and an icecream cone over your still warm corpse instead a a BBQ over it.
Water the fruit trees by learning about Jesus, Ask for his spirit To weed out sin and help you overcome.
So you DO give them the meth (at first) and THEN still kill them just before they open the safe?
I hope this includes people on the internet, because the preachy weed crusade on reddit will turn a thread about potato salad into a War on Drugs debate if you let them.
Norwegians can't dope or what?
They were 8/100 on the Transparency Index, joint bottom with Afghanistan and Somalia.
You are laughing toothless because of your meth habit.
Plus the weed so I remember maybe one dream every couple weeks.
The achievement states that you need to bring additional meth to the deal.
Right now your body is a lot more sensitive to being off dope and is readjusting.
Olhem, deixo-vos uma receita de bolo de bolacha - camadas alternadas de bolacha e creme - que 99% dos restaurantes portugueses não sabem fazer como deve ser:

I think I just smoked weed and tried to exercise.
(Trevor missions and a few meth missions Online).
As for the achievement, [I did it using this method.](http://www.trueachievements.com/a178657/caribbean-pirate-achievement.htm)
Once you are at Day 2, unload all the meth bags and put them all on the trunk as instructed by the mission objectives.
Open the safe with whatever method you prefer to get the info while your partners are bagging up the cash.
Make sure to get all the bags of cash in the level and load them into the van along with the 5-6 bags of meth.
Not sure about the coffee but the weed is definitely good.
Don't hit up sphincter boy's friends for weed I guess.
that guy is dope ahaha
I imagine at some point in time long ago, weed must have been much more mellow and relaxing with positive vibes.
And if you're wondering, I once smoked some weed with a buddy and I was convinced (and I still am to this day), that the weed I was smoking came from some alien race using it to implant certain thoughts into our minds or tag certain humans for something in the future.
Smoke some weed before paying attention and your mind will be blown.
I got 30mls of Pebbles and the cinnamon toast.
If you've ever done xanax you know that's insane 
Some dope clips on there.
It was my first time meeting the guy however he was a frat brother of my best friend and seemed pretty trustworthy; I had just never heard of concentrated xanax.
Sidenote: any opinion on snorting vs popping molly?
Currently I've been messing around with meth and I can honestly say I never thought this would happen.
However, in SF, ended up homeless, got caught in a public park selling weed to someone.
Ohh try the pebbles first! Since I can't vape I have been smelling the bottle and it's heaveen.
Those who do smoke weed, probably have a reason for it.
AKA: meditation isn't a suitable replacement for smoking weed in any way.
That doesn't mean that I'm saying meditation is bad or worse than smoking weed, it means that meditation is irrelevant to the act of smoking weed.
How are you willing to throw everything away just to limit your weed intake? No only will you spend less money but your tolerance will go way down.
I can see why many people consider shrooms to be so enlightening.
Ideally everyone should get a good dose of offense periodically so we can weed out the extreme reactions.
I smoked weed everyday of high school and graduated mighty fine.
Those who do smoke weed, probably have a reason for it.
I'll definitely be more careful with weed from now on.
The scene where Jennifer Aniston is trying to prevent the mom from seeing her weed baby.
The game promotion would be dope hyrule warriors with splatoon would seal the deal for me lol.
There never was a country that was so blinded by propaganda that they believed that some people were less than others, and they certainly never put them in camps to weed out those undesireable humans.
I don't drink coffee or smoke weed and I'm from Scotland where it is always raining anyway.
Just know that you took acid and if you start getting scared that itll be over soon.
I do not mind woman being on TV Shows I just find it hard to believe that they will recreate the top gear experience with 2 blokes and a woman.
The weed and coffee is MUCH better here, there is NO traffic to speak of, the scenery is beautiful and it doesn't rain too much.
I know many people wouldn't accept that as real Top Gear though.
I mean, we see Molly who is rather...not maligned, but ignored, I suppose...defeat Bellatrix - so power manifests itself in weird ways in the Potterverse.
as someone who takes cs u see some kinda dope fits with cargos sometimes 
I thought gen VI was pretty dope 
[Those who do smoke weed, probably have a reason for it.
Replacing smoking weed with meditation doesn't have the same effect]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34t2ym/what_does_everyone_spend_too_much_money_on/cqxtg6w)
Makes me think of the Red Weed of War Of The Worlds, just without the colours.
Top Gear was the perfect British programme.
I know exactly what you mean! My friends think it's weird that when I buy weed I only buy in very small amounts--it's because if I don't, I'll smoke constantly.
Its a really dope mouse.
Around here 2001 oxycotton i had just heard about was about 20$ for a 80MG or so.........
fast forward to 2008 or so the same 80MG green oxys you could shoot had jumped to almost 100$ or 120$...
I have been on pretty much every type of antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anti-anxiety medication and none of them compared to weed.
You could always mix your hash with weed if you want hash without tobacco.
Or just get a pipe and smoke the hash pure, sometimes it doesn't really burn well, but that's when you add the weed.
I absolutely love Guy Martin and all the programmes that he does, but there's no way that I can see him being willing to present top gear.

1 monster meat and 3 red shrooms make meat balls.
They even tried to sell Salvia here as a legal weed alternative for a while.
*SMOKE WEED EVERY DAY!!!*
How many people do you still think have weed dealers in Colorado? Some, I'm sure, especially as easy as weed is to grow, but do you think there's *real* profit in it there anymore? When the profit dries up so does the supply.
Some people use datura or wormwood or henbane....Really I think weed is safer than a lot of these.
I met Alexi Lalas and Kasey Keller at a USA game.
Collins without tripping over a brewpub &amp; falling into a brewery....or weed store.
What eats me up is how those agencies can get 12k out of the pizza joint when similar businesses seemingly only have $300 to spend on a website...but they want the 12k level job.
Everything is prairie until BAM, you hit humid forests and the methed out abomination that is the state of Missouri.
There are millions of issues and problems out there and all they can think about is legalizing weed in the states they live in.
Not a troll guys, I call it the Weed Holiday too
And thankfully they are pretty calm about dope in my hometown.
If they'd replaced Jeremy with him and then been able to keep James and Hammond then Top Gear might have been able to limp on.
Are the speed limits really as ridiculous as Top Gear made them out to be?
Whatever show the 3 of them create will overtake rebooted Top Gear regardless.

In fact, in Hinduism, weed is considered sacred.
Every base you mentioned where joint training takes place, is just that, a base.
Do you know what the 'professional' lawn care companies spray for weed killer?
When I drink 3-4 beers a joint is perfect (but only without tobacco), more and I just feel unconfortable drunk.
Except by mescaline you probably mean some random psychedelic amphetamine with similar effects courtesy of China.
I doubt that this will happen but the idea is nice.
And no I used to smoke weed a lot but dont smoke any more and occasionally social drinking but not alot 
It's not really a surprise, but it just goes to show that even with improved testing and more anti-doping measures, doping will still exist, and if it's possible to dope you can bet that a lot of people are doing it.
Benzoic and salicylic acid creams and washes don't seem to be helping.
Yeah man, smoke weed with friends.
No one smokes salvia a second time as a legal weed alternative.
I've smoked 5 grams of meth over a week.
For me, giving her hugs and kisses first thing reminds us both that we're in love, not just joint caretakers of a home and son.
Even Austin and Keller admited this idea was way too much to ask.
Remember that there's an arm joint and there is also a joint built into the upper torso for more movement.
Solely move the arm joint as it is more stable.
If this doesn't work, do what you did to the leg joint.
Hydrate yourself with a decent amount of whiskey or if you can I'd down about 6mg of Xanax or K-pins.
Had he gone to CU Boulder, he never gets in trouble for having weed in his car because it isn't illegal.
Just replace a few of the beers with weed and thats how it is down here.
And the weed makes you dependent on it to level you out.
I think I remember Jason Mewes saying he did upwards of 60 oxys a day sometimes.
Went on Top Gear a few days ago.
I don't care if you smoke weed or cigarettes I look at them the same way, disgusting 
one of my favorite ways of meeting people at a festy is to bring some weed and just ask around for someone that has a bowl.
And even *if* a drug can fulfill both purposes the methods to obtain it, if legalized, would not be the same.

music-wise 83 was a little bit better since Thriller was released and Duran Duran happened, but 84 was still a super solid year in music - I mean, Purple Rain was released.

If you have an investment account before you get married, never mingle that account with any of your joint money.
It might work, if BBC throws stupid amounts of money at it and provides it with extensive timeslot support -- support the original Top Gear never really got.
The head-to-head comparison would be brutal, and Top Gear will constantly be in their shadow as distant copy.
For example, someone buying weed could be getting some portion of synthetic as well cut in if not entirely synthetic.
Resulting in meth by cooking salt water, I don't think logic applies here
Smoke weed every day! 360 no scope! YOLO SWAG! com @ m3 m8! 1v1 me fog!1!!1!11353!4!5!6356
Of course, I didn’t feel a thing LOL I was lakeside, just out of town enjoying a scrumptious double cheeseburger at an old school drive-in burger joint when my phone started blowing up with people asking me about the earthquake.
Clarkson said he was starting his own new show doing the same thingthey did on top gear and Hammond and May are going with him.
They refused to keep shooting top gear without him
Of course, I didn’t feel a thing LOL I was lakeside, just out of town enjoying a scrumptious double cheeseburger at an old school drive-in burger joint when my phone started blowing up with people asking me about the earthquake.
in my opinion id rather high quality weed than low quality as you wont smoke as much :) and can last longer and will enjoy it alot more use to smoke alot of trim/outdoor to save a few pound but figured out if I smoked a joint of coffee shop material I was alot better :)
Okay so it wasn't just me that automatically thought wow, weed really doesn't kill peoples judgment.
[Olly Murs Interview &amp; Lap](https://dailymotion.com/video/x2hur9z)|[2](http://reddit.com/r/videos/comments/34qyta/_/cqxs8hz) - He was on Top Gear too.
I prefer weed or smoke.
Over time, you weed them out and have a nice neat lawn.
You search for cheese but after 2 hours you find none, you find instead a meth lab...
This is the method i use and confirm it works.
First of all the main reason of taking hard drugs for me is I wanted to experience that part of life and know how it was, I am not addicted to any of em except a little to weed (just a little, can live without it).
If you haven't smoked in a while, a small amount of weed (as in a single joint smoke once) should also be out of your system in 4-5 days, but I wouldn't risk it.
Maybe just a little meth in my coffee before my presentation
Because the shops can get in trouble for selling weed paraphernalia.
Regarding the anxiousness, you may be smoking a Sativa "heady high" strain which comes with the racing mind effect, and sometimes increased anxiety.
I'd recommend going with a pure Indica or a hybrid of both, but not a Sativa dominant strain.
The first question to ask yourself is how much time you have to devote to developing new hobbies and interests - that will help you weed out the ones that are too time-intensive for you and help you focus in on what's really important to you (in other words, what's worth spending your free time on).
A guy in my high school died in a meaningless little scuffle when a guy half his size hit him in the temple.
I've done just fine without weed at a party, so have my friends who choose not to smoke it.
Get yourself some nice indica weed that can at least partially reduce craving and still kill pain.
I don't see Top Gear as a show but instead as 3 people, such as Bruce Wayne =Batman Hammond, May, and Clarkson are Top Gear.
It may be called Top Gear but the final season of Scrubs was still called Scrubs, it's a technicality at best.
Better than that, why does it matter? I understand border control asks to weed out people with bad stories right away.
A good way to practice is to inhale some smoke, take the joint away from your mouth and say PIZZA while inhaling air :)
When you haven't smoked for a few days, with the money that you would've spent on weed buy yourself something nice.
They now smoke weed and denounce racism.
Have to agree with this guy - If I were you I'd be more afraid about arriving to China high or with weed in your urine :) but that's one long flight to recover
If your smoking with friends i recommend the entire Acid Raps album by Chance the rapper
Ask them to put on some Phish, they have a pretty dope show on dvd.
Well my bus was a joint and a 40 late this morning.
That chin cleft and gorgeous smile also give you a raging case of, rawr, how you doin'?", which I also suspect will be with you for life, unless you employ fastness therapy combined with meth teeth.
Vaping weed whilst driving could result in a crash, which, I guess, could damage your battery.
If you are a fan of top Gear then the least you can do is approach the show with an open mind.
I question myself a lot on what point smoking weed became a necessity, I just want rid of this hold that it has over me bro.
Can't imagine how it feels on an acid trip.
It's probably $200 worth of dope if that.
If it was a 1v1, I still think Weed is more capable, he did intense sword training for a year, Ark, not so much.
I thought she was so dope in this scene but that is an unflattering derp face right there, friend.
The spirit is the same and that is basically, in my opinion, to not let weed rule your life anymore.
you get shrooms that are water instead of alkaloids :P
The thing that made Top Gear great was the trio, not the surrounding car show.
They are taking revenge for the Opium Wars humiliation and the later dismemberment of the Middle Kingdom after the unequal treaties that followed the wars.
Tape the joint to restrict flexion so you can't even half-crimp with that finger.
She's just depositing the money in the joint bank account to pay it.
If you and your husband are splitting custody equally, and you make more money, even if he's imputed at full time, you may owe him child support - though possibly less than the $291 the calculator says because the court may deviate when there is a joint physical custody arrangement:

He never did it in front of me (the only drugs I do are poppers and sometimes weed every 6 months or so), but I later found out he did do it when he "took a shower".
Smoke weed everyday.
I chatted with him at a local BBQ joint near campus after the SMU-UCF game.
Those geometric animal heads are insanely dope man, wow.
Extra weight + joint problems = doesn't exactly make anything good.
It'll be similar to Top Gear US.
Your joint bank accounts can be seized or frozen.
Off topic, but after the weed thing, I read "pot roast" completely incorrectly
Same with allot of other drugs, accept for ketamine and GHB.
I don't want them knowing I'm a weed smoker.
I don't think so, I think its just a dope character design, personally.
In the evening I add Joint supplement (we use Jointmax granules) and coconut oil.

"If you don't swallow the ketamine drip, you won't get any long term stomach problems".
Little bit of ketamine here and there.
She received approximately 7% of their joint net worth in the divorce, despite being there for building the majority of it.
So if someone decides not to prosecute a kid in possession of weed in order to not waste hours of police time and not let the kid off, they are ratted out?
Because you cannot dope one atom...
i won't,if bbc choose them for completely new and different show with different name then it would be ok,but for top gear absolutely no
I just enjoy smoking in general! But weed makes me feel good...
At the beginning that was the plan, joint academy and training and a friendly every year, but it fizzled out after one friendly.
We talked for a few days and eventually got hungry and decided we should fix that in a joint effort.
Why is it called the joint task force? Do they commonly work with American special forces?
Bryan Cranston said on a Howard Stern interview that they actually made real meth with a DEA agent to make the show accurate.
Yeah exactly! I'm lazy as hell and happen to smoke weed.
I don't smoke weed and become lazy as hell.
In fact, weed inspires me to not be lazy more often than not.
Don't expect to see a perfect copy of the old Top Gear.
Same as Top Gear US, or Fifth Gear.
Functioning meth heads are few are far between, it will ruin you eventually.
My advice, quit now, and don't entertain the thought of meth.
If you've never listened to it on acid (or especially if you've never listened to it at all) I SO recommend listening to Dark Side of the Moon from start to finish.
The BBC is owned by the British people and Top Gear was one of its biggest breadwinners.
So you can smoke a joint with one hand on the keyboard and one on the mouse?
Such a dope dude.
At Volum 14 weed just entered the dwarven village and still dosn't even have elemental sculpting.
There are the people who smoke and you don't really know unless you happen to be around them at that exact moment, but then there are the people who talk incessantly about weed, dress in clothes with leaves on them, "4/20 bro!!!" no ambition, etc.
The meth wouldn't have actually been blue.
The purest meth possible would have been pretty colorless, because the colors are impurities 
I am only just wrapping my head around being able to walk into a shop and buy weed within the next 10 years or so(UK).
Sounds pretty dope to me.
We should all smoke weed XD
Just can't control Xanax.
I've taken acid with me on planes before, but that was on EU flights only.
The offical plan is to start selling weed in LATE 2016.
Most of the time I smoke by myself and it's either a whole joint or blunt or just a bowl in my pipe.
All that, and I would NEVER shoot up Ketamine.
I'm as dope as two rappers you better be scared, 'cause that means Albert E=mc^2 !
Thats the think most people don't remember about weed.
I smoked one joint and my roommates all got pregnant!
Virginia is pretty dope if you're into visiting the homes of presidents.
Sometimes I take half a pill of Xanax just cuz.
Pretty dope to be able to say you work for the "Prince" too.
Lol he said "take 6 mgs of k pins or xanax" as if they are interchangeable hahaha.

We've made several joint purchases towards our future (ex: a dining room set, a new bed, a couch etc....some are at my house, some at his).
Yeah, he should have thrown pebbles at them to lure them out one by one
when did top gear US got good?
It could also be something else too, weed effects everyone differently.
I just know from my experience with smoking weed (~9 years) that I used it to escape my problems instead of dealing with them immediately.
Long hair cats are expensive or these gray but soft ones forgot their names.
Getting and staying clean from dope is really hard.

How long have you been taking the tianeptine? Are you taking the standard doses suggested, and not dosages above or below? Furthermore, did you order the free acid or the sodium salt? The free acid will have a different absorption rate and may have different effects that the sodium salt.
The case for continued prohibition of methamphetamine is easy to argue from a medical standpoint.

What's your page? I'm down for collabs if you shoot me some dope loops
our O-line looks dope and our QB's protected,
Another point to note about ABV is that when you vape weed you are only releasing certain chemicals depending on the temperature you are using.
I have read arguments from both sides and I come to the conclusion that benzene actually being a problem in weed via vaping is very dubious.
If you are going the edible route just use fresh green weed and don't bother vaping and then using ABV.
Some of us have to get by throwing pebbles we find lying around to communicate.

I used to smoke weed a casual-moderate amount and love it to death but eventually I developed anxiety symptoms and had to stop.
I was as enjoyably high as I had ever been on weed but without any negative symptoms.
As for the taste when I started vaping I noticed I got to taste much more of the weed through the vapor.
You describing it as dry isn't uncommon just due to the heat of the vapor and the length of time you end up hitting the vape, which is usually much longer than say a pipe or a joint hit.
I tell the officer I was smoking a joint not too long before being pulled over.
So what can make weed go moldy? this is something I've never experienced and hope to avoid.
My parent's weren't in love with the decisions I made (dropped religion, smoked weed openly, etc), but the funny part is that I maintained a 3.8 GPA, was an active member of my college and had a job with the school.

When Molly Norris made a cartoon about "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", I see no reason to doubt her claim that "this was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion."
It's better' than when I smoked weed 4 times a day to escape.
He still gets called molly to this day.
Well our love not only for music but specifically what kinds of sounds and tempos is a human evolved trait and ketamine kind of takes you away from your brain and gives you an outside perspective so maybe that's why.

Then, once all the gold is dissolved, you've got to precipitate it out of the acidic solution.

Do markets *eventually* weed out some of the idiots? Yes.
I don't think you can get mescaline precursor containing cacti in home depot

When Molly Norris made a cartoon about "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", I see no reason to doubt her claim that "this was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion."
That is bubblegum og crystalblaze cookie special kush for sure I can tell from the tricombs.
long story short my house was ruined (lightning) so we are living in the temp home, and mom asked me to not take weed in the house so i respect her wishes.
Why would they smoke weed if the dad who clearly would have a problem was still in the house?
And the car's pretty dope too.
(2) "Bad" CO weed is still better than whatever they are used to in Nebraska or wherever they are from.

First of all your weed looks well grinded, but just try to grind it a little bit smaller (just to make sure the problem is not the weed).

The stimulant he chose is called Desoxyn, or methamphetamine HCl.
Yes, methamphetamine.
To counteract those side effects, he prescribed Klonopin and Xanax (benzodiazepines).
I went up to 60mg methamphetamine twice daily, but the Xanax/Klonopin kept going up and up.
Eventually he had me on 12mg Klonopin per day, along with up to 6mg Xanax to be taken as needed (or in my case, as much as possible).
Eventually, I had to resort to buying more Xanax "on the street", and started smoking crystal meth.
Apparently he was treating many of his patients with ketamine.
He would give me an intramuscular injection of ketamine in his office, and I would dissociate/hallucinate for about an hour while lying on his couch, and then go home.

Anyways tho, this is dope af.

Even if I were willing to accept that that truly *was* the best Molly could find in a shop that was within her budget, do you really mean to tell me that Arthur didn't have a set of robes that Ron could borrow? The movie made it even worse when *everyone*, including Ron's siblings, were laughing at him.
I think they were talking about not getting help for serious medical conditions because they believe the weed has it covered.
Granted, some heavy meth users or such might not make the cut.
See I'd heard about really bad hangovers from molly but I've never gotten it.
In my opinion it also helps show that it is a joint decision as well, and that one person isn't more vocal than the other.

Good BBQ joint across the street behind the field (walking distance, there's a foot path behind the nearby camper dealer).

In a way, the Clarkson-Hammond-May era of Top Gear died in an anecdote.
Speaking as a former xanax user, it's no doubt the most accurate musical representation of a drug I've ever heard.
I love the fact that Molly is the most lovely and powerful mother figure that Harry could possible have in his life.
I love Molly Weasley.
Maybe Molly thought he would need it during the nine months Ron was at school, maybe she just wanted to get Ron a set of his own.
For example many bodybuilders have limited joint movement which can lead to crippling arthritis later on in their life.

To 91 you'll need ~270 dwarf weed seeds, 105 palm tree seeds and 90 magic seeds.

Also, not sure how it works in the UK, but in America, just because some crazy, concerned parent tells the police that they saw someone smoke weed the other day, doesn't mean that anything is going to happen....in fact, the police will probably come over to their house and shoot them in the face.
Smoking weed is no big deal.
Adidas x The hundreds is doPE 
I go to Smart Motors in Madison, Wi for all my maintenance and I get solid advice for about what I was paying for the same service at a local garage for repairs and an oil change joint for maintenance.
The weed will probably have some resin in it from the smoke going though it which is fine, possibly added potency.
Try /r/saplings for any future weed questions.
Smoking weed therefore falls into that category, as do just about every other drug on the planet.
If I want to drop acid every day of my life, what right do you have to tell me I can't? 
I was smoking weed and blowing it out my window (using a pipe, taking really small hits) and didn't realize my mom was outside.

This is an excellent procedure as it allows the joint materials to relax so full compression may be made with the torque wrench.

One day, you'll be on your own and can smoke weed in your apartment surrounded by pizza boxes, dirty clothes and video games.
I was smoking a ton of cowboy extracts but they don't have any taste, although they claim to be BHO free.
This could be pretty dope for photshops and stuff too.
Palabra de Aznar: No creo que defienda la paz mejor quien mas grita, sino el que defiende la legalidad, la libertad individual y la democracia; no creo que defienda mejor la paz, quien no se atreve a asumir responsabilidades, sino quien ante momentos dificiles tambien es capaz de asumir responsabilidades ante los ciudadanos y ante la comunidad internacional.

Edit: was gonna fix the spelling of joint to join, but now im thinking the irony is humorous.
Hey! You're that never done meth guy! A little random but yeah, I have you tagged.
Reg weed is low grade weed, kush is good weed (even though most of the time it's just okay), and the best weed goes by its specific strain name.
If someone says they have some kush it's probably pretty standard stuff unless they go the extra mile to elaborate how good it is.
A dealer will never say they have standard weed because it makes their weed look bad.
Smoke weed every day.
And for someone who doesn't care about the legality, why did you respond to my initial comment about that very subject? My guess is you haven't thought this subject through but you want to justify your gut reaction of hating people who smoke weed.

I feel the exact same effect that OP does if I smoke weed early anyway
(Interpretation: Michigan may actually be meth.
Everyone might be doing meth)
I definitely agree weed- actually all drugs imo- needs to be legalized, but should we do it at the national level right away, or is the state legalization working?
did you even read? You had two parts to your statement, one about burgers and one about the legality of weed.
What part of my initial comment even remotely addressed the latter? I just thought it was ridiculous you compared smoking weed to eating a burger.
Certainly they need to come closer than the American Top Gear did, or I'll turn it off just as fast as I did that.
smoking weed and sitting on the couch will only make depression/anxiety worse if reaches the level of becoming your lifestyle.
Instead of smoking weed and sitting on the couch, smoke weed and then go for a walk.
Smoke weed and then go to the gym.
You think urban legends about theme park deaths are awesome? Try getting in a shoddy Paperclip manned by a meth head jonesing for his lunch break during a long 16...
What was the dosage of 2cb that you took? I only ask because experience with weed and mdma won't really help you in the deeper waters of shrooms.
Shrooms are weird for me and take my mind to a much different place than even acid does.
I stepped up my dosage with shrooms very carefully, starting with 1.5g, then a 2g, 2.5g, etc.

I'm surprised you even took the risk of your parents smelling you burning the weed.
I sent that late, I was describing the taste of meth lol.
...that you take a picture of something stupid just because it says something that can also be construed as part of weed culture?
Your TL;DR says my girlfriend has decided to go to a concert alone so she can trip out on shrooms rather than go sober with me.
This is really really dope bro.
[I busted a nut on shrooms during a wu-tang encore](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1j2bk9/sharing_my_most_unbelievable_concert_experience/)
I've also sshared a joint with Nas and Damien Marley
in fact a single methyl group that meth is named after can easily make an enormous difference, in this case in diffusion.
I based what I said on the "I love everything, wow." behaviour but Ketamine sounds spot on.
That Karla Kush vid is Top 10 material.
What makes me most uncomfortable is "oh yeah shrooms are fine" wut?
Do speak to someone local about this before marriage, and especially before creating any joint bank accounts.

This is the exact reason I put filters in joints and blunts.

I still do smoke weed weekly tho.

Didn't get caught, weed and gear that was left on the table was untouched.
It's also sensitive to flaws in it's crystal structure, or voids in the ceramic (not as bad of an issue thanks to modern manufacturing methods, but ignore that).
Are you both on a lease, or some other debt obligation? Do you have any joint accounts? Are credit cards in both names? Do you have any heirlooms or sentimental items to stash first? Is there any potential for violence or retribution from the person? Do you have a place to go? 
But the second part of the clip really sounds dope in terms of voice and accent.
It also had a hint of a Ketamine closed eye visual feeling.

Pryhme is dope but even Royce himself will admit he's one of hip hops biggest under performers.
If these three (who are good friends with each other) took over Top Gear then it would instantly be better.
But I doubt the BBC has the balls to pay them what they would have to in order to get all 3 even though Top Gear is worth a fortune and won't be with the pablum that they are planning.

I just find that kush tends to appeal to those who aren't looking at or aware of the bigger picture, which is to say that you have energy to manage and you're gonna lose a lot more of it to a heavier strain of cannabis.
There is a particular effect to most kush and it can be somewhat mind-numbing at times.

you want the easy way? the easiest way is to decarb or use AVB, and eat it or just dump it into brownie mix, but if you're doing that, then you must have lots of weed to waste, and i think some of our more dankrupt friends might resent you a bit.

* sativas give more of a heady high, especially when vaped.
It was a Sativa heavy strain, this makes sense.
If you use weed to avoid some type of real world problem/issue, then you really have to deal with what needs to be done before you feel better and "lighter".
In any case, I won't be carrying any weed on me, so I think the second-hand story is fairly viable.
With me opiates and dope is my perfect medication for anything.
Any post on here about weed is considered bad for the growth of the sport i guess, but posting about disc golf on /r/trees is different
If only there were someway to relight a joint that's gone out
The Chinese are still quite upset about the colonisation efforts of the West and the national humiliations such as the Opium Wars and the international concessions in Shanghai, etc.
My ring finger touches the mouse only at the second joint and extends past the mouse to my desk - my pinky isn't on the mouse at all.
Some of the best bud I bought in CO wasn't at a listed shop on weedmaps
I spend about 20 minutes 2x per week just walking my lawns &amp; weeding.
Best results in weeding, to get the whole rootstem, is to do it right after a good rain - or these days after a good watering with the sprinkler.

Well I'm honestly just guessing maybe they had so many applications that she had to weed out sub masters/challenger.
I've actually stopped talking about weed or drugs around them all together.
Tadoe on dat molly water
It is kind of lame but when I smoke weed my emotions runs pretty deep.
that'd be dope man! much appreciated
If scientists found out that generations of people taking psychedelics is what made us smarter than other animals, which animal would you give shrooms to?
On shrooms I just feel colors, feel connected to all living things, and life around me becomes grand.
* They don't know a better way to weed out which coaches are actually good and can work with the team, so if you go by elo at least you get someone who knows the game.
Everclear mixed with a little vg works pretty well though where you can get 1g of good bho or concentrates into a mix of 5-6ml of everclear:vg in 2:1 ratio seems best
I also have an Izanagi-less Athena team (Athena, Meimei, Verche, first-uvo Valk, Kush or Godin or P&amp;D Bear, Athena)...
It's my job to know who deals, where it's going, where the secret little smoke spots are, etc.
Edit: just a few days ago I found a fire trench and definite hangout spot in the woods over the hill, I busted seven students with an open fire and a bag of weed.
I didn't turn them in for the weed, but I did everything else.
Also, if you do an enhanced spear and keep tapping r2 he just a dope as thing
Just wondering how you guys feel about this, closest thing to a molly I've ever found
Despite his strength, He-Man is a thinker, not a brute.
Maybe when I retire, I'll smoke weed and play video games all day.
Get a couple xanax just incase and know that whatever your feeling is just the drug.
Also its worth mentioning that its dope that this subreddit has Kanye West and Taylor Swift flairs.
since then i've tripped multiple times and learned to control myself in that state and even learned to control shrooms and i enjoy them now.
Day I got out I was given a joint by a colleague.
Even thought they didn't write it, the Stannis the Daddis moment in Ep.4 was pretty dope though.
A long (long) time ago, you did a show with They Might Be Giants where you announced a joint venture to fix their Dial-A-Song service.
I'd definitely give more credence to that theory than "I smoked weed and now I want all of the meth and other nice drugs" hahaha
It's taken me a while but I've gotten more comfortable over time, just ease into heavier weights and understand how importance warm ups and joint maintenance is.
A lot of people here have a problem of generalizing weed smokers.
Everyone on the weed subs are really chill.
it might have been a bad sprain or slight tear in your AC joint.
I got a bad sprained AC joint for a car accident.
I'm jealous of your ability to score some weed so soon after discharge.
When I was younger, I could've easily been in your same situation (minus the telling the cop I just finished smoking weed prior to him pulling me over.
In many states, he could file for joint custody, and if he chose to be an active parent, that would reduce his child support obligation.
If that's too low, it doesn't entirely cover my MTP joint (outside of big toe / ball of foot) and I'm miserable.
I see many other people suggesting Saginaw and Keller, both cities I've lived in as well.
If you're a health nut, Keller is central to a number of healthy restaurants, gyms, and great parks.
If you can't find what you want to do in Saginaw - Keller, Roanoke, Lake Worth, and Downtown are just a short drive away.
So much weed has been smoked in those seven days off.
I'm thinking of writing a to do list so that when I'm craving weed and can a list of things I want to do that will distract me from wanting to smoke.
Even worse: Top Gear USA
Youd think people would be people wherever they are, but you can see the differences in the cannabis cups and festivals held that advertise sativas more over there and they win more often than they do here in the states.
great post op :) I make my brownies similar except am able to use much less weed by first decarboxilating the weed by putting it in the oven on a cookie tray at about 240 F for an hour, and then letting the oil/butter simmer for 3 hours instead of your 45 min.
All this commotion seemed to be stirring up the fiery spirits of the other bar goers as they now loomed closer to the scuffle primal hunger in their eyes.* 
The weed that you obviously smoked before typing this
So you RELIT the joint in front of him, then hit it, then asked him? Because no joint stays lit for 10 to 15 minutes.
Injury robbed him of his top gear this season, and it really affected his entire game.
haha he actually swore off weed after that.
We just need to accept the golden age of top gear has past and hope they can pull something out of the hat that's reasonably interesting.
Any number of methods could have given a brief update on Jorah without being so horribly blatent - the show chose the most basic, obvious method.
That last point has nothing to do with Barristan's importance; it's practically a continuity error that such a famed swordsman went down without any real fight, or, conversely, why such a good fighter would throw his life away fighting an unwinnable street scuffle that meant nothing.
I took acid for the first time at a party, there were seven of us, all of us tripping for the first time.
But I had an excellent time, a few of us brought guitars and drums and we jammed for a long time, smoked some weed, listened to music, just had an all around good time.
Ultimately this is how you weed out the bad from the good - the ones who are willing to open their minds and realize there's more than 1 way to get things done and some methods are just more optimal than others.
It smells really strongly, even when stored in a bag with lots of things surrounding it, so having it out in the open isn't really an option if you live in a place where weed is illegal.
Dogs are dope 
Ahora estoy en el gabacho así que no te puedo presumir un Speedtest.
Seen him live at edc last year and he wasn't heavy on the mic at all but he's dope and we're both philly natives.
Now the fact that they're half-saiyan might let them get away with the possibility of joint problems but it still seems to be a bad parenting problem.
I wouldn't say "original" as original top gear was pretty lame and far too factual.
I can't find any weed up here in Alaska (I'm new up here and don't socialize).
Sounds dope haha, soundcloud rappers are always the dopest 
Those are dope can u link me?
Not saying it will be good, but I've wanted Top Gear to do that for a while.
SMOKE WEED EVERY DAY
GHB mixed with vaped meth is extremely enjoyable.
Trap on narrow paths in the jungle and entrances to Baron and Dragon also secure escape routes in your jungle with Shrooms 
what was relevant was that burgers should not be compared to weed, the topic you're ignoring.
But just so you know, it's possible that I can agree with you that it's legal, but at the same time disagree with your pathetic burger / weed comparison argument.
Taking weed for example, there's lots of instances of psychosis from edibles.
The next question would be (specific to ptsd) why do they think that shrooms will be beneficial for stress and anxiety? Why not concentrate on the transcendental/enlightening aspects of shrooms instead? Especially in the traditional shamanic or advanced-meditative context.
When I smoked weed and realized it wasn't bad, then progressed to L and shrooms and mdma and it wasn't bad, I tried opiates.
Once I found him, I realized this seemingly dry town actually has a huge dope problem.
started smoking weed 15 years ago (everyday)
Nothing better than a joint shared on the summit.
I compared them because weed and burgers are both enjoyable things that no one needs to smoke or eat, both can lead to poor health if not used appropriately, and both should be legal.
Local Mexican joint called El Torrasco.
even drug addicts -- beggars who want money not for "food" but for meth -- are people fighting to figure it out.
[According to this](http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm#dreaming) alcohol before bed causes less REM sleep, so less dreams, but I'm not sure if weed works similarly or not.
Edit: Just read the other article posted in this thread, it does indeed seem that weed causes us to spend less time in REM sleep, though the ultimate effect of this on the brain is unclear.
jodie kidd - has been on top gear twice
The 40 looks so dope and Idk I haven't gotten it yet it's in on its way! 
Or 9s haha it's whatever though, still got some dope stuff, nice collection bro!
If I want a really, really amazingly crazy good burger I can go to a local joint and pay maybe $10-$15 for the best.
Tim Keller is a public figure BTW, so I hope this won't get taken down because I didn't blot his face and name out.
Even though he's a dope with his kid and dog, he's there for all of us, at the drop of the hat, no matter what he's doing, and is there for us.
If 10mg of oxy lights you up, Seeds may be a fun time for you
Just trying to get as much information as possible on the safety of this, since it's basically the first drug outside of alcohol and weed that I'm considering trying recreationally.
Irrespective of that, the clavicular head MUST be adjacent to the deltoid origin, or else there is a pretty significant problem at that joint (acromion, clavicle head, head of humerus).
That was a dope show.

1 joint equals 4 pregnant teenagers? TIL I am the reason for 100% of the people alive today.

Kush is a strain of weed, not all good weed is kush.
I didn't find weed killers to be even remotely effective, just a lot of elbow grease.

If i could get 800mg oxy a day Handed to me...
But I'd totally understand if you're puffing a joint right now.
You can't vandalize and smoke weed (I live in a decriminalized state, so still illegal).
Fertilizer and possible weed killer.
Eh, man look I'm sorry for calling you weed smoker.
OG Kush is craft no matter how much you grow and restricting labeling to those that grow under a certain amount is asinine.
Pretty dope of you to do this thingamabob where you go look at peoples channels.
the act of throwing the weed in the river empowers you to stop
hey man, obviously excited about this guy's work ethic, but no need to bring weed into this.
Hash is not a weed strain, hash is concentrated weed resin.
Anyhoo, I had a customer once tell me that she was allergic to Fettucini, and asked for Angel Hair pasta instead...
It's reminded me of working at a hotel where the waiters used to smoke weed in front of the maître because she was so sheltered that she didn't know what it was and everyone else didn't care enough or thought it was funny.
Well in Seattle we got legal weed which both cures what ails you and makes everything taste better.
Reminds me of what Top Gear did during the [pendulum test for the Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust](https://vimeo.com/18220559#t=87s)
I miss Top Gear :(
Kush is a term for weed if you're under the age of 18 I feel.
Only hear teenagers talking about Kush, yet don't know The many strains of it

Many obese people need joint replacements in their 50's or 60's.
UChicago has a statistics program for undergrad as a major or minor (or a joint degree).

Take away from the reference from age or whether you're in high school or college or working at a fast food joint or whatever.
Buy a stolen $1000 TV for $200 worth of dope, turn around, sell it for $400 cash, free money.
Teemo shrooms aren't powerful enough.
I don't have any suggestions for you except for the basics of good glue joints: perfectly flat, perfectly clean, even clamping pressure.
Anyway, after you simmer the weed and oil and strain the oil from the weed, you just put the oil in the brownies right? and if so what do you do with the left over MJ? just throw it out? or is it usable for smoking or maybe on a pbj or something.
Yea 120 xanax is high, without good indica or some other sedative I can take 2 xaxax bars easy per day (always need a few extra for the gals).

After my first trip on shrooms I was able to let go of every single grudge I had.

But the current Pebbles already load faster than those animations.
And dope is science?
lol I have a dope job with just my CCNA.
Now however I use methylphenidate and I found that intranasal provides better focus with less comedown.
Now that I have my life balanced its a much better tool and with coffee, weed and occasionally Etizolam it's working how it's supposed to.
Jezza was pretty funny in the old Top Gear too.
Hamster and Slow did a couple of reviews before for old Top Gear but yeah no one would have thought they'ld become that big.
When Tiff and co left to make Fifth Gear, Jezza made Top Gear completely his show.
Ithink she took a Xanax later but the only lasting effect is being overly paranoid about making sure the alarm is set while she's home.

yea unless its really weed eventually you'll feel something.
Edit: jk had three bowls of cocoa pebbles and I'm going to bed now
I tend to joint one side of a board with hand planes, and then run it through the machine to joint the other side.
I really enjoy the hand jointing process, but jointing a single face of a board fulfills that need and having the planer helps speed projects up to a pace that allows me to complete more projects.
Here's a funfact though: MillerCoors is actually a joint marketing venture in North America.
Am I right in remembering that Harry, Molly and someone else were all fighting at the same time in the book?
We need to weed out corruption without killing the whole animal.

I need to smoke A LOT of weed to get any high at all.
Now by the time it hits the states it has been cut several times at the least with whatever the people moving it have on hand, on the least harmful side of the scale you have b vitamins, or baby laxatives (make you fart a lot), on the most harmful side of things you have amphetamines including meth amphetamine.

Cops used to actively try to bust people for smoking or possession of small amounts of weed.

But he said he talked to his lawyer and since I was joint owner it was fine to just keep it as it was and not go through any legal proceeding.
Still dope though
I've never bought king skins and not smoked a joint within 30 minutes, this could be a viable policing technique.
So in my opinion, do not use Xanax to deal with depression, it won't be worth it
Stealth: A bit better than stoneisland, not sure if this was because I ordered some weed as well to conceal the smell.
Search on here or CoC forums to see *probable* trap locations and various methods to destroy it.

In later chapters Seoyoon and Weed grow more together as the misunderstanding also clears.
[Weed begins to care for her and hang out with her more, along with the fact that Seoyoon tries her best to support and be the best girlfriend Weed could ask for; from dressing up nice, cooking his lunch for him, and earning her own money to go on a trip with him(She scuffed her figures when making lunch boxes to sell, in order to earn enough money to go on a beach trip with him) So with that, Weed slowly opens up with her and tries his best to be supportive.

And always remember, stop putting meth in your coffee after 6 pm.

So I've [heard](http://i.imgur.com/O4rwybb.jpg) you're an avid weed connoisseur, what's your favorite strain and how often do you blaze?
I'm all for legalizing pot but in the case of say meth is it conscionable to allow someone free and unrestricted use of the drug?
The little nubs on the side of the stone are what creates the joint between the stone so that the sand can go in.
And yet, a few decades ago, people never thought anyone would never need a résumé to apply to a job at a grocery store or fast food joint or retail store...
It's whatever to me, I'll have weed and booze regardless.
It's entirely possible for a veteran to take that joint to the face and still keep on going.
Most people don't, of course, just as most drug users don't have problems either (may not be true of meth and others, don't really know).
Do you know where La Paz is? no, not the capital of Bolivia.
La Paz, Mexico.
Given that well-produced meth is in exactly the same category, it probably just woke those brain cells up.
Everyone hated Top Gear USA when it first came out but ended up being content with it about half way into Season 3.
This might not be the same because this isn't American Top Gear, it's the original.

The next question would be (specific to ptsd) why do they think that shrooms will be beneficial for stress and anxiety? Why not concentrate on the transcendental/enlightening aspects of shrooms instead? Especially in the traditional shamanic or advanced-meditative context.
After a long hiatus, you were part of my motivation to revisit shrooms (as a complement to spiritual practices).
Thanks man, I know how to make magic rice krispie treats, just never thought of doing fruit pebbles is all.
When I was prescribed Xanax I had the worst munchies of my life.
We had been drinking and doing meth for about a day and a half and something in him abruptly changed.
When I said it "makes it easy to green out on just a few hits," I meant hits off a joint or a Launch Box.

Coco Dyno Bites are so much better than coco pebbles and much cheaper.

He's a Rastafari at heart, and wishes the person also smoked as much weed as him.
Everyone feels at least a little anxious during the comeup: The transition between normal consciousness to tripping on a fairly high amount of acid can be pretty breathtaking but doesn't have to be overwhelming and I can almost guarantee that you'll still be able to communicate with others and be aware of your surroundings so no need to worry about that.
your life must dope if this is the worst question you get asks
I agree about everything, except they were less than one year apart, and Molly was older! 
I completely agree with the applications of Xanax you just listed.
Is there anything I can say to get my doc to write me a script for Pfizer Xanax bars instead of tablets? My last script was for the equivalent of 8 bars, in 0.5 mg tablets.
Left to do some stuff when Molly walked out and was surprised to see Hughes leave the mound at the end of the inning
If you smoke a lot you need to get filters for joints.

He sells liquid psylocybin thats extracted from ~2g dried shrooms per dose.
How can you generalize that to all police officers, or even any others? I know a guy who smokes weed and he dropped out of high school and works a minimum wage job living with his parents.

Honestly, I'd love to smoke weed and trib with Hayley :) I'm sure she'd enjoy it.
In case you meant illegal drugs, I've tried a few and plan to try more, and so far I've found that pot helps me relax and sleep and has allowed me to get closer to some of my friends, and shrooms have activated my synesthesia to an extent.
Today and told him i want off the Xanax and benzos all together.
someone on a heavy dose of acid, maybe ?
The man-made flavors, such as strawberry banana kush or sherry berry chocolate that you mentioned, can be created in one of several ways.
* Bottled essences (menthol, spearmint, vanilla, maple, peppermint, fruits, etc.) can be used by dropping them on a cotton ball and putting the cotton ball in a sealed jar with the weed, which will eventually diffuse throughout the jar, flavoring the weed.
* Fragrant flower parts can be added to a sealed jar with the weed, which have the same effect as the fruit peels and essences.
* Spirits (wine, port, sherry, whiskey, etc.) can be dropped onto a cotton ball and added to the jar of weed.
Happy your teeth are already gone so that the meth can't get to 'em.
Forget about college applications, going to CERN is dope enough by itself.
I don't know if it would fit your narrative, but my old DM wanted a memorable last session before leaving so he made it so the BBEG ate shrooms that transported him in a sort of dream world and the only way to get to him was to eat the same shrooms.

Primatene is just epinephrine, which is not a useful meth precursor.
I quit most psychs completely, with the exception of mescaline.
400 mgs of mescaline hcl feels sooo peaceful and I'd recommend giving that a shot.
My wife and I are in a similar situation, but we stay below the penalty income by contributing to retirement accounts (401k) to bring our joint taxable income below the threshold.

The British did pretty well for themselves during the Opium wars as well.
The Master Kush is part of the GroupGrow so I guess it's week 17 from seed?
The master kush is in week 7 of flower, as is the fools gold.
It's not a professor's job (or even a high school teacher's job) to Molly coddle all the students.
Oh, and obviously Colby Keller and Dale Cooper.
Two months later I start the car, drive up a short Hill and when I hit the top the wheel pops out of the ball joint due to the ball having become smaller and smaller.
I'd smoke weed over taking Xanax any day.
Rolling the joint itself might me a bit more difficult, but if you have some experience it shouldn't be to hard
My love of poppy seed tea makes me want to try opium anymore.
I believe in a future where weed is almost treated as sugar where its so plentiful and relatively low cost that you could bother your neighbor for an eigth every once in a while and it'd be no big deal.

I oxy first to clean and de-label, just do a hot rinse after, no detergent.
When I'm suicidal I can smoke a joint or take klonopin or (heaven forbid) go to my final resting place.
Maybe that something is to not do meth over a 2 day binge?

Over time these got better, although since that experience weed made me a lot more anxious than it ever did before.
So my main advice would be, try to abstain from weed at all costs!
It's dope because it's literally [a transcription of Antonio Vivaldi's The Four Seasons Spring, movement 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:01_-_Vivaldi_Spring_mvt_1_Allegro_-_John_Harrison_violin.ogg).
Don't smoke any weed today.
Hopefully the MKX online scene lasts long enough to actually develop the game and weed out that mentality.
A dope route would be to take the 58 from Eugene out into the Umpqua national forest to Crater Lake.
I just searched trees for mold weed and seems it happens to lot a people and half the people say nothing major will happen and the other half say throw it.
All I can hear is "smoke weed everyday"...
